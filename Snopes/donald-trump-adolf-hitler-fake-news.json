  "Example": "[Collected via Email, December 2015] Is Donald trump related to hitler? Origin:On 8 December 2015, the entertainment website The Good Lord Above published an article claiming that Donald Trump was related to Adolf Hitler: A new report released today proves that billionaire presidential candidate Donald Trump is a not-so-distant relative of Adolph Hitler. Trump is related to Hitler on his paternal grandmother's side, said Charles Perry, director of the National Genealogical Society, which released the study. She lived in Bavaria and married Adolph Hitler's grand uncle from Austria-Hungary, Johann Schicklgruber. There is no truth the above-quoted story. The National Genealogical Society has not released a study connecting Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Its director is not named Charles Perry, and in fact, there does not appear to be a Charles Perry working there at all. The Good Lord Above is a satire web site that does not publish factual stories: Thou shalt remember that The First Amendment protects satire as a form of free speech and expression. TheGoodLordAbove uses invented names in all of its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.
