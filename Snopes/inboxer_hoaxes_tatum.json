  "Origins": "On 28 May 2015, a news-like link began to circulate on Facebook claiming popular actor Channing Tatum came out as gay. The link's headline stated \"Channing Tatum comes out as Gay,\" and the preview text read: \"Channing Tatum comes out as Gay following a number of rumours.\"",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "While the rumor was briefly popular on sites like Twitter and Facebook among Tatum's fans, it was generated by the site Feednewz.com. Feednewz.com is neither a news nor fake news site; its primary purpose is the generation of user-submitted links that appear to be news stories. As with a similar viral hoax involving EastEnders actor Danny Dyer , the Channing Tatum hoax spread atypically far for a FeedNewz.com link due to user interest in the fabricated claim. Claims like the one about Tatum often spread due to a compelling headline alone. Readers who clicked through to the appended link were greeted with the following image revealing the prank: Channing Tatum did not reveal any new information about his sexuality, and he remains married to actor Jenna Dewan .",
