  "Origins": "This photo of a truck with a tailgate display featuring an anti-Obama decal bearing the legend \"Does this socialist a** make my truck look too big?\", along with a photograph of Barack Obama dressed as a Somali elder during a 2006 visit to Kenya and an apparently real banana, was posted to Reddit by a user named bluchunks in mid-October 2014. Contextual information visible in the photo indicates it was snapped in the East Texas town of Tyler, at the intersection of Loop 323 and Highway 155. The image was widely circulated on the Internet, typically reproduced with a label referring to it as the \"most racist decal ever.\"",
