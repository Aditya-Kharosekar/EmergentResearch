  "Origins": "On 5 February 2015, an image of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was posted to the Facebook page \"Stop The World, the Teabaggers Want Off,\" along with a quote purportedly uttered by her during an appearance on the Glenn Beck Program on 28 January 2015: There's a connection between vaccinations and homosexuality. Anybody with eyes can see that. It doesn't take a doctor to figure that out.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "But the former Alaska governor said no such thing. The \"Stop the World\" Facebook group is a satirical one that frequently attributes fictitious quotes to conservative politicians. On 1 January 2014, the group claimed Palin made offensive comments about \"white privilege,\" and on 13 January 2015, the group attributed a dubious diatribe questioning Michelle Obama's feminine qualities to Mitt Romney. The group's disclaimer page notes its material is satirical and intended for \"entertainment purposes\" only: This page is for entertainment purposes. It is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It is primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages.",
