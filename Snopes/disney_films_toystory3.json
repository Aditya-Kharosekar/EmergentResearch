  "Origins": "When we started this web site way back in 1994, the very first articles we published were about various risqu images and messages supposedly slipped into Disney films a few of them real, most of them products of viewers' imaginations. The years since then have seen the addition of a third class of risqu Disney film \"Easter eggs\": fakes created through the process of digital image manipulation.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The June 2010 release of Toy Story 3 , the second sequel in the popular PIXAR/Disney Toy Story series of films, was quickly followed by the circulation of the image displayed above, which purportedly captured a risqu scenario hidden in the film: the toy characters reacting with wide-eyed shock to the off-camera sight of their now grown-up owner, Andy (who is about to leave home to begin college), engaging in a decidedly adult activity suggested to viewers by the shadow the participants cast on the floor of Andy's room. (The image was typically posted on the web or e-mailed with a title of \"Andy's All Grown Up\" or \"Andy's Room All Grown Up.\") This tableau did not actually appear in any version of Toy Story 3 , however. It was created by simply adding the suggestive shadow image into a scene which originally featured rather ordinary shadowing effects:",
