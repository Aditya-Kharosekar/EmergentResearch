  "Origins": "On 23 February 2015, a rumor started circulating via Twitter that singer Beyonc Knowles had been killed in a car crash.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Unlike most celebrity death hoaxes , the rumor about Beyonc was not tied to the publication of a fake news article. Instead, it appears that boredom and a few Internet trolls were responsible for this rumor's spread: I'm bout to get this trending... #RIPBeyonce Matt. (@MattMcGraiI) February 24, 2015 The Twitter account @CNNNewsFacts (which has no affiliation with CNN) then attached the #RIPBeyonce hashtag to a photograph in an effort to perpetuate the rumor that Beyonc had passed away: The above-displayed photo does not depict a car crash involving Beyonc , although it does capture a celebrity fatal crash site: The image was widely circulated via Twitter shortly after the death of Fast and Furious star Paul Walker in 2013.",
