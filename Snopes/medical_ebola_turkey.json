  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "It barely warrants mentioning there is no business named \"Texas Prime Turkey Farm\" anywhere in Texas, as Daily Buzz Live is a frequent offender in the starting and spreading of spurious, \"satirical\" claims. Among previous fake news stories peddled by the site are a totally fabricated story of a chainsaw killer at a Halloween attraction, a yarn about a woman who was being buried alive when her screams alerted funeralgoers, a claim that McDonald's uses worm meat as a filler in their hamburgers, and a rumor that new iPhone 6 units were contaminated with Ebola.",
