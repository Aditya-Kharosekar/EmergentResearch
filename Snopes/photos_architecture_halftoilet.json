  "Origins": "The above image showing a bizarre half toilet was widely circulated in February 2014 in conjunction with the opening of that year's Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and was offered as an emblematic depiction of the slipshod planning and construction of Olympic facilities (some real, some not) that various western reporters had chronicled discovering in that city.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The origin of this image is unclear (it might be, for example, a photo of an art exhibit, a digital creation, or a staged scene), but it appeared as an entry in a captioning contest posted on the web site Bits & Pieces back in August 2013, six months before the opening of the 2014 Winter Olympics, so it obviously wasn't a recent photo snapped at an Olympic facility in Sochi as claimed when it made the rounds of social media in February 2014.",
