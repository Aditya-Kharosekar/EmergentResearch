The Facebook group \"Stop The World, The Teabaggers Want Off\" frequently posts fictitious quote memes from politicians and conservative TV personalities, including dubious diatribes attributed to Sarah Palin, Ann Coulter and Mitt Romney. These memes are frequently shared outside the context of the \"Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want Off\" group and mistaken for authentic quotes. A disclaimer on the group's Facebook page, however, states that their material \"is for entertainment purposes\" and \"is NOT meant to be taken seriously.\" Last updated: 20 August 2015",
