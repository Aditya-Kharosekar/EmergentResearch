  "Origins": "This video clip of a man (engineer Bruno Kammerl) in a neoprene suit shooting down a waterslide, flying off a ramp, traveling an amazingly long distance, and landing smack in the middle of a tiny wading pool hit the Internet in August 2009. It's not a recording of a real event, but rather a viral advertisement for Microsoft Germany accomplished through a combination of video editing techniques : It's a case of creative compositing, meaning that the clip we get to see is based on multiple elements that were combined together to create a final video. A stuntman slides down the slide, secured by a rope. Then there's a body flying through the air, which is animated. And finally, the big splash. \"He actually jumped from a wooden ramp into the pool,\" explained [Maik] Koenigs. Of course, you don t get to see any of this in the final clip, thanks to careful editing that makes it look like a single take.",
