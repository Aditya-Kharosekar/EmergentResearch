  "Origins": "This essay on \"A Secret of Love\", written from the perspective of a man about his love for his wife, has been widely circulated via social media in the last few years and is typically attributed to actor Brad Pitt. But Pitt didn't have a wife for several years: his five-year marriage to actress Jennifer Aniston ended in 2005, and although he was subsequently involved in a long-term relationship with actress Angelina Jolie, they did not get married until August 2014 when this item had already been circulating for more than a year.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "We don't yet know who the original author of this bit of romantic fluffery was, but this item was making the social media rounds long before Brad Pitt's name became attached to it, and a rep for the actor confirmed for us that he had nothing to do with it. A number of linguistic issues in the piece suggest that it was either written by someone who is not a native speaker of English or it was imperfectly translated into English from another language.",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, June 2013] Brad Pitt about His Wife A Secret of Love My wife got sick. She was constantly nervous because of problems at work, personal life, her failures and problems with children. She has lost 30 pounds and weighted about 90 pounds in her 35 years. She got very skinny, and was constantly crying. She was not a happy woman. She had suffered from continuing headaches, heart pain and jammed nerves in her back and ribs. She did not sleep well, falling asleep only in the morning and got tired very quickly during the day. Our relationship was on the verge of break up. Her beauty was leaving her somewhere, she had bags under her eyes, she was poking her head, and stopped taking care of herself. She refused to shoot the films and rejected any role. I lost hope and thought that we ll get divorced soon ... But then I decided to act on it. After all I ve got the most beautiful woman on the earth. She is the ideal of more than half of men and women on earth, and I was the one allowed to fall asleep next to her and to hug her shoulders. I began to pepper her with flowers, kisses and complements. I surprised her and pleased every minute. I gave her lots of gifts and lived just for her. I spoke in public only about her. I incorporated all themes in her direction. I praised her in front of her own and our mutual friends. You won t believe, but she has blossomed. She became even better than before. She gained weight, was no longer nervous and she loved me even more than ever. I had no clue that she CAN love that much. And then I realized one thing: \"The woman is the reflection of her man\" Brad Pitt",
