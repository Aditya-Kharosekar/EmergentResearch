  "Origins": "On 19 February 2015, a rumor started circulating via Twitter that musician Macklemore had joined the terrorist group ISIS.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The rumor stemmed from a fake tweet that was created to look like a message sent from Macklemore's account. The bogus tweet was frequently attached to the hashtag #MacklemoreJoinedISIS, which soon became a worldwide trending topic: I can't believe #MacklemoreJoinedISIS pic.twitter.com/fDar52geZI Kyle Wirtz (@KyleWirtz4) February 20, 2015 Macklemore, however, is not affiliated in any way with the terrorist group ISIS. This is a fake tweet that was most likely created with a combination of Photoshop and a program such as Let Me Tweet That for You . These programs make it very easy for people to post social media messages that appear to come from celebrities. The following message, for instance, was also never posted to Macklemore's Twitter account:",
