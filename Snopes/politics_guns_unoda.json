  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Although UNODA is a real office within the United Nations, it has not created a \"Civilian Weapons Confiscation Study Group\" with the goal of disarming civilians in member nations. The document shown above is a fabricated one, as evidenced by its invalid document number (A/CN.11/L72) and the fact that the bar code and QR code shown at the bottom of the document (which uniquely identify a UN document) match those of a completely different document . This image is actually an altered version of an older document (A/CN.10/L.70) from October 2012 which simply announced an upcoming substantive session of the Disarmament Commission to be held in April 2013:",
