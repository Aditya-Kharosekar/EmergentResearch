  "Example": "[Collected via Email, January 2016] I'm wondering if it's true that Animal (from The Muppets) is dead. I've seen a couple of articles that say he is. But, also a couple of articles claiming it's satire or a hoax. Origin:On 20 January 2016, the entertainment web site Waterford Whispers News published an article claiming that the character Animal from The Muppets had passed away at the age of 66: TRIBUTES have been flooding in from all across the world following the death of Animal, the legendary drummer with rock outfit Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem. Fans of the supergroup were shocked to learn of the passing of the iconic percussionist, who passed away at just 66 following a short illness. Remaining band members Dr. Teeth, Janice, Zoot and Floyd Pepper took to the group s Facebook fan page to announce the sad news earlier today. We will never forget you, brother, read the statement from the band. You kept rocking til the very end. Be at peace now, and we ll play again in that great muppet theatre in the sky . It's unclear how Animal, a Muppet, could die, but we have received several emails concerning the fictional creature's well-being. It's likely that some people assumed that the actor who played Animal had passed away, or perhaps that the character was being retired. At any rate, there is no truth to the above-displayed article. Frank Oz, who voiced Animal on The Muppets, is still alive. The character is also featured on the new Muppets show, although he is voiced by a different actor, Eric Jacobson. Waterford Whispers News is a satire publication that does not publish factual news stories: Waterford Whispers News is a fabricated satirical newspaper and comedy website published by Waterford Whispers News. Waterford Whispers News uses invented names in all its stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental. Animal the Muppet lives on. Last updated: 21 January 2016 Originally published: 21 January 2016",
