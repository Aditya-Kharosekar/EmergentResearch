  "Origins": "Despite rumors that comedian/actor Sinbad (the stage name of David Adkins) died in March 2007, the 50-year-old entertainer is alive and well. The misinformation that he passed away from a heart attack was merely part of a prank spread through a phony on-line biographic entry.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "An Associated Press reporter contacted Sinbad on 15 March 2007 and wrote: Actor-comedian Sinbad had the last laugh after a Florida-based Internet reference site announced he was dead. Sinbad first got a telephone call from his daughter. The gossip quieted, but a few days later the 50-year-old entertainer said the phone calls, text messages and e-mails started pouring in by the hundreds. \"I rose from the dead and then died again,\" the Los Angeles-based entertainer told The Associated Press in a phone interview. When asked if he was upset about the mix-up, Sinbad, whose real name is David Adkins, just laughed. \"It's gonna be more commonplace as the Internet opens up more and more. It's not that strange,\" he replied. \"Sinbad is in great health, his crazy self, nothing's changed,\" his publicist Maria Savoy said. EURweb.com has an article that reproduces a phone call with Sinbad's brother/manager, Mark Adkins, confirming the comedian's not-deadness.",
