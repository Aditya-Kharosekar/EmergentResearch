  "Description": "Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, the article was just a bit of satire from Empire News , a web site that publishes fictional stories such as \"Cure for Cancer Discovered; 'Amazingly Simple' Says Researcher,\" and \"College Student Excused from Classes After Dog Eats Grandmother,\" and \"Woman Gives Birth, Confuses Doctors by Asking for Maternity Test.\" Empire News 's disclaimer page notes that it \"is a satirical and entertainment website.\" (A real-life case of a newborn found to be carrying twin fetuses was reported in February 2015, several months after Empire News ' publication of this satirical article.)",
