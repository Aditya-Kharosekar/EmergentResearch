  "Origins": "Although many institutes of higher learning do indeed make ice cream available with every meal (either in a school-run cafeteria or a residence hall dining room), none of them does so specifically because a benefactor stipulated they do so as a condition of his bestowing money upon the school. This tale tends to circulate in tandem with the \"grieving benefactor imposed a swim test requirement\" legend. Both narratives most often mention Eleanor Elkins Widener, who endowed Harvard with millions of dollars and allegedly placed some unusual restrictions on how the money could be spent. According to Harvard, however, ice cream is served there every day not because of a donor's stipulation, but \"because most kids like it.\"",
