  "Origins": "\"I am not a member of any organized party I am a Democrat,\" quipped Will Rogers in one of the more famous examples of American political humor. The clip displayed above is more humor in a similar vein, a segment from the 1940 Bob Hope film The Ghost Breakers , synopsized thusly on the IMDb : Mary Carter (Paulette Goddard) inherits her family's ancestral home, located on a small island off Cuba, and, despite warnings and death threats, decides to take possession of the reputedly haunted castle. She is joined by radio broadcaster Larry Lawrence (Bob Hope) who, believing he has killed a mob gunsel, flees New York with his butler, Alex. Once on the island the threesome enter the eerie castle and, after viewing the ghost of one of Mary's ancestors and fighting off a menacing zombie, they find the key to the castle's treasure but are interrupted by an all-too-human foe. In the scene shown here, Larry Lawrence and Mary Carter inquire of Geoff Montgomery (Richard Carlson) about the nature of creatures known as \"zombies,\" providing the set-up for a Bob Hope zinger:",
