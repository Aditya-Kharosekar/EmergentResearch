  "Origins": "In May 2014, Nashville police announced they had arrested someone named Peyton Manning on felony drug charges, a headline that led many readers to believe the drug suspect was the Peyton Manning famous for being a star National Football League (NFL) quarterback who is a five-time league MVP and has helmed the backfield of the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos since entering the NFL in 1998. But, in fact, the Peyton Manning arrested by Nashville police was not a 38-year-old NFL quarterback but rather an 18-year-old woman of the same name:",
