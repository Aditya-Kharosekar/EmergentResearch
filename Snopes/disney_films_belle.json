  "Origins": "Belle appears during the film's second musical number, the sequence in which Quasimodo sings \"Out There\" from atop the roof of the Notre Dame cathedral. As the camera slowly pans down and along a street reminiscent of Belle's home town in Beauty and the Beast towards a small group of people, Belle appears in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, walking and reading a book (and wearing her blue dress, of course). In the same scene, a sharp-eyed viewer can catch glimpses of a rooftop satellite dish, The Lion King's Pumbaa being carried by two men with a pole, and a street merchant shaking out the flying carpet from Aladdin.",
