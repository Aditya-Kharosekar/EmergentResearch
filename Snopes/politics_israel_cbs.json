  "Origins": "As far as CBS will divulge, they're not planning to run anything like the segment described above. The CBS program which airs at 9:00 AM on Sundays is CBS Sunday Morning , but according to a Sunday Morning staffer whom we spoke with, the Sunday program (which is ninety minutes long) never devotes a full thirty minutes to a single topic, nor are they planning to air a segment having to do with the Israeli Defense Forces during the week of March 9. Either someone has confused CBS Sunday Morning with another program, or the information in this message was made up for reasons unknown.",

  "Example": "[Collected on the Internet, 2003] CBS is having an unprecedented program this Sun., Mar. 9, at 9:00 am (8:00 central). The entire half-hour will be devoted to telling stories of Israel Defense Forces soldiers, from their point of view. Watch it, or tape it, if you can. Just as important, call the TV station afterwards, to compliment them on their coverage. We know that they will get tons of calls and emails criticizing the program, so it's VERY important to balance the feedback!! Please forward this to all your friends.
