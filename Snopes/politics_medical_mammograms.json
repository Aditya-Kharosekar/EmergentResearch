  "Origins": "During the debate between presidential candidates on 16 October 2012, President Barack Obama mentioned Planned Parenthood several times, on one occasion stating women \"rely on Planned Parenthood for ... mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.\" That statement drew criticism asserting that President Obama had falsely implied that Planned Parenthood health centers themselves conduct mammogram procedures.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "It is true in a literal sense that Planned Parenthood health centers do not themselves conduct mammograms (a procedure which requires specialized equipment and expertise to use it). Planned Parenthood offers comprehensive breast health care management, which includes manual breast exams as well as patient education on breast health. That care management program includes providing women with information about mammograms, referring them to health centers where they can obtain mammograms, and assisting them in covering the costs of the procedure by referring them to government programs that provide free mammograms or by using grant funds to reimburse the medical providers who perform the mammograms. (Referrals for mammograms often require the patient has undergone a breast exam within the previous year.)",
