  "Origins": "In February 2015, an image began circulating via Facebook that supposedly depicted a warning issued by the Michigan Department of National Resources (DNR) about polar bears roaming that state after having crossed over from Canada in search of food.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "There was no warning about an influx of polar bears posted on the Michigan DNR 's web site or Facebook page, and the image was easily dismissed as a piece of poorly executed Photoshop. Polar bears are arctic animals that live in the northernmost parts of Canada, Greenland, Russia, and Norway. The only state in the United States that regularly provides a home to polar bears is Alaska: The fake warning about polar bears claimed that the arctic animals were crossing into Michigan from Canada over a frozen Lake Erie, but this is not a very direct route for hungry ursines to take, as Lake Erie touches Michigan only in the state's southeast corner. If Canadian polar bears truly wanted to feast on unsuspecting Michiganders, the more direct path would be for them to cross Lake Huron or Lake Superior into the Upper Peninsula.",
