  "Origins": "A photograph purportedly showing a can of Coca-Cola Garlic has been circulating on the Internet since at least 2014. The image is typically accompanied by text explaining this fictional flavor of Coca-Cola is available in Romania:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The above-displayed image, however, was not taken at a grocery store in Romania. The original photograph , taken in France in 2011 by Flickr user Jos Roitberg, showed a can of Coca-Cola Cherry; the original logo was then stripped from it and replaced with a fictional one for Coca-Cola Garlic: As of 2015, there is no garlic Coca-Cola product available in Romania (or elsewhere), but that could change in the future. Food and Wine reported in February 2015 that Takkola, a garlic-flavored cola drink, was the new craze in Japan.",
