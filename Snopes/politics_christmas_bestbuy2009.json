  "Origins": "In November 2009, the Best Buy chain of retail electronics stores touched off a brouhaha when one of their \"Shop Thanksgiving Day\" advertising circulars included the words \"Happy Eid al-Adha,\" a reference to a Muslim holiday which in 2009 fell on November 27 (i.e., the day after Thanksgiving):",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Best Buy representatives maintained that the company's mentioning Eid al-Adha in a Thanksgiving circular did not mean that Best Buy was abjuring the use of the word \"Christmas\" in their holiday promotional material (something the chain had been criticized for in previous years), telling the Detroit News that: \"Best Buy's customers and employees around the world represent a variety of faiths and denominations\" and the company is trying to be \"inclusive\" in the consumer markets they serve. \"We respect that diversity and choose to greet our customers and employees in ways that reflect their traditions,\" said spokeswoman Lisa Svac Hawks in a written statement. \"In addition to Happy Eid, you will see greetings of Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Joyous Kwanzaa and Feliz Navidad in various Best Buy communications during the holiday season.\"",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, November 2009] There is an online flyer by Best Buy (for period Nov. 22 thru Nov. 25) that, in the lower lefthand corner, shows a Muslim holiday greeting of \"Happy Eid al-Adha\" just above the Happy Thanksgiving banner. Is this true or fabricated (since they don't want to wish anyone a Merry Christmas)?",
