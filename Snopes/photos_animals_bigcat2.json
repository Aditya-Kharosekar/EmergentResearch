  "Origins": "Some people were tempted to dismiss this photograph as a hoax created through digital manipulation due to its similarity to another \" big cat \" picture from a few years back, but we were not quite so skeptical. As we noted on another page about cats with an unusual style of haircut , felines generally have coats of fur that create the illusion of girth and make them appear to be much larger than they really are.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The photograph reproduced above looked to us as if it could quite plausibly be a genuine picture of one of the larger breeds of domestic cats (such as the Maine Coon ) the cat's being stretched out full-length in the woman's arms leaves it looking much longer than it would seem if it were posed in a normal stance, and its luxurious, fluffed-out coat of hair creates an added impression of extra thickness. This photograph seemed to our eyes to depict nothing more than a typical hefty-sized cat photographed in a way that emphasized it size, and that proved to be the case. The feline pictured is 2-year-old Maine Coon named Riley, photographed in the arms of his owner, Martha. According to Martha, Riley has lost a bit of weight recently, but he weighed about 24 lbs. at the time the picture displayed above was taken. Here are some additional photos of Riley with Martha, and a picture of Riley with his sister, Callie:",
