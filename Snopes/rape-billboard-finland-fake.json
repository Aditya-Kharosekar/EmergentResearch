  "Example": "[Collected via Email, January 2016] People are posting a billboard and claiming in Finland you can be an immigrant and get away with rape. It shows three black men raping 1 white woman. Is this real? Origin:In January 2016, several disreputable web sites such as USA Daily Politics and Jews News published a photograph purportedly showing a billboard in Finland that stated that it was legal for refugees arriving in that country to rape women: The above-displayed image does not depict a real billboard in Finland. This fakery has been circulating since at least 2008 and was likely created back then in an attempt to tarnish Finland's Green League political party Vihreat. The fake image is based on a real billboard that was posted by Doctors Without Borders in Liberia. The real billboard said nothing about \"refugees\" or Finland's Green League political party; instead, it instructed rape victims to \"seek free treatment immediately\" at a local clinic: The altered photo, which was changed from its original to show three dark-skinned men assaulting a blonde woman, plays to popular racist tropes about swarthy men and helpless fair-skinned women, which has been used as an excuse for violence against minorities for generations.
