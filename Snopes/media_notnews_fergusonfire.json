  "Origins": "On 26 November 2014, the Daily Currant published an article titled \"Ferguson Protester Accidentally Burns Down Own House.\" Referencing the recent civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri (and in other locations around the United States), due to a grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer who shot and killed Mike Brown, the site claimed a protester mistook his home for a local business and mistakenly set fire to it:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Despite its convincing tone, this article was just another humorous bit from the Daily Currant , a fake news site. The site's About page makes no effort to hide its satirical nature, and previous fictional articles from that site include pieces about dozens of Coloradans dying of marijuana overdoses shortly after cannabis was legalized in the state for recreational purposes and Sarah Palin's claiming that Jesus celebrated Easter. According to the Daily Currant 's disclaimer: Our stories are purely fictional. However they are meant to address real-world issues through satire and often refer and link to real events happening in the world.",
