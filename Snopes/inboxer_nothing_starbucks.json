  "Description": "The Starbucks 'My Favorite Way to Cool Down This Summer' coupon reproduced above redeemable through 30 August 2008 for a free tall frappucino, ice brewed coffee, iced espresso, or iced tea beverage at any participating U.S. Starbucks store was apparently an in-store coupon (hence the \"Bring this back to your favorite Starbucks\" legend) that someone scanned and put out on the Internet without authorization. Although some Starbucks outlets may accept printed versions of this coupon, many readers have reported to us that their attempts to redeem such coupons at various Starbucks stores were rebuffed, and Starbucks responded to our query by stating that coupons distributed via the Internet are \"unauthorized\": Thank you for contacting Starbucks Coffee Company. We want to thank you for bringing this unauthorized use of the Starbucks name to our attention. Starbucks does not endorse and is not responsible in any way for this coupon duplication. Starbucks does not offer coupons via the internet or e-mail. Thank you again for contacting Starbucks Coffee Company. Sincerely, Julie S. Customer Relations Starbucks Coffee Company",
