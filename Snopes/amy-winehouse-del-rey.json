  "Example": "[Collected via Twitter, January 2016] Origin:A photograph purportedly showing singers Amy Winehouse and Lana Del Rey hanging out together has been circulating since at least June 2015. While the exact origins of the above-displayed image are unknown, it is a composite of two separate photos. The photo of Amy Winehouse was taken in 2011 in London: Amy Winehouse heads to the Hawley Arms pub in Camden, north London, wearing a pink Pringle sweater. Amy had earlier attended a recording session at the famous Abbey Road studios with Taylor Swift. The photograph of Lana Del Rey was taken in 2012 before a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert: This photo of Lana Del Rey was flipped in order to make the composite image of Rey and Winehouse. One way to tell that the image has been flipped is by looking at the lettering on Del Rey's AC/DC shirt, which is backwards on the composite image. This isn't the first time that a composite image of two celebrities has circulated as the real thing. Shortly after the deaths of Lemmy and David Bowie, a fake photograph purportedly showing the two together at a party went viral. Last updated: 22 January 2016 Originally published: 22 January 2016",
