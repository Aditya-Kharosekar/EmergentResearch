  "Origins": "A photograph showing a Ferguson protester holding a sign reading \"No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store\" was posted to the photo-sharing site Imgur on 27 November 2014 by user Bdawgid. That image was accompanied by the following message:",

  "Description": "The black community has every reason to be angry with the police, and the brutality they inflict. But making a martyr out of the kid that robbed a store and attacked a police officer is just mind boggling. Micheal Brown is one of the worst things to happen to race relations in a long time. Although the above-displayed photograph does depict three protesters standing outside a fire department in Ferguson, Missouri, the wording on the sign has been altered. The original photograph was taken by Mitch Ryals and was published in the Riverfront Times on 1 October 2014; it documents the message on the sign carried by the center protester actually read: \"No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he leaves home\": Imgur user Bdawgid eventually admitted he had manipulated the image: Yes, I shopped this. It captured mine, and many others, frustration with this whole situation.",
