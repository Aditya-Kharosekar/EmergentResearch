  "Example": "[Collected via Email, January 2016] Several blogs and verified twitter users reporting that the animated series Darkwing Duck is returning in 2018. Is this true? Origin:On 21 January 2016, several web sites such as i09 and TV Overmind published articles claiming that the popular animated show Darkwing Duck would return to television in 2018: Darkwing Duck, which aired its last new episode in 1992, will return to TV in 2018. Plenty of time to get dangerous. While both i09 and TV Overmind are both credible news sources, the story about Darkwing Duck's revival originated with an April Fool's joke that was published by Nerd Reactor on 1 April 2015. Shortly after realizing that they had been duped, i09 published a retraction: It looks like we, and TV Overmind, were tricked by an old April Fool s post dated April 2, 2015. Sorry about that. As of January 2016, Disney has not announced any plans to revive the Darkwing Duck television show. Last updated: 21 January 2016 Originally published: 21 January 2016",
