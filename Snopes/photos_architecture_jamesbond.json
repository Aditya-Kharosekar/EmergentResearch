  "Origins": "In April 2015, a Photoshop-created image of a house standing atop a very narrow rock formation recirculated online. The image that viewers were then debating as a photograph of an \"abandoned house in England\" had been shared under a variety of other titles over the years, commonly referred to as Ireland's \"Castle House Island\" and shared on Reddit as the ideal \"Zombie Fortress.\"",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The image's creator, digital artist Jan Oliehoek , has also shared the image under a few titles of his own. He called it \"Dream House\" when it was posted to Deviant Art , and \"Bond's Neighbor\" when it was awarded second place in the Worth 1000 web site's \"Bizarrchitecture 7\" Photoshop contest. (The \"Bond's Neighbor\" title was a reference to a Bizarrchitecture 3 submission dubbed \" Bond's Mansion .\") Although the photograph is obviously a digital creation, it is based on the melding of two real sites. Oliehoek combined a photo of the Lichtenstein Castle near Baden-W rttemberg, Germany, with one Ko Tapu (also known as Nail Island) in Thailand: The latter formation earned the nickname \"James Bond Island\" after it was featured in a scene from The Man with the Golden Gun .",
