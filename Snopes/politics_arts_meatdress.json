  "Origins": "For those who missed all the sizzle or didn't understand what was at steak, I've sliced off some excerpts from a 1991 newspaper article which pretty much cuts to the shank of it. Er, lean-trimmed to make this easier on your diet:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Yet another prime cut, this one from closer to the bone, comes from another 1991 article: A sculpture of a dress made of raw meat, hanging at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, has outraged politicians and food-aid agencies. The sculpture, made of 50 pounds of salted flank steak, is a waste of food and taxpayers' money, critics say. But museum curators defend the work, \"Vanitas,\" as a graphic reminder of mortality and the aging process. \"It's a powerful piece,\" Helen Murphy, a museum spokeswoman, said yesterday. \"It can be quite repugnant, even to people who eat meat. People just aren't prepared in some cases to say this is art.\" The meat dress by Montreal artist Jana Sterbak is on a hanger beside a photo of a woman wearing it. When the meat decomposes after six weeks, it will be replaced with another $260 worth of fresh meat. \"Vanitas,\" on display since March 8, will remain until May 20 before traveling to the United States and Europe.
