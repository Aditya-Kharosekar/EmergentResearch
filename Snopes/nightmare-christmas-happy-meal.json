  "Origins": "On 23 September 2015 a Facebook user published the image and caption embedded above, suggesting that a Happy Meal based upon the popular film The Nightmare Before Christmas would coming to McDonald's restaurants beginning 1 October 2015. Like previous Facebook Halloween-based release rumors (involving a \"McOuija\" Happy Meal and a poster heralding the purported release of Hocus Pocus 2), the viral Nightmare Before Christmas Happy Meal photograph was a fan-created one and not a legitimate promotional image.",
