  "Origins": "On 25 October 2015, a Facebook user published the above-reproduced photograph and information about the driver of a Porsche abandoning a dog on the page \"South Carolina Lost Pets,\" urging fellow social media users to keep an eye out for the motorist. On 26 October 2015 the original poster of the image further directed commenters to contact a separate individual, sharing a screenshot of a Messenger conversation claiming that the Porsche's driver stopped to help (not dump) the dog:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Not long after, the original poster stated she had confirmed that the driver of the Porsche was merely a passerby and not responsible for the dog's abandonment: I'm checking on reports the person has already been questioned and possibly not a dumper. Spoke with the K9 Officer who worked this case and he has confirmed with me the man was a passerby. Update others and delete. Last updated: 26 October 2015",
