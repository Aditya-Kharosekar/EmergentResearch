  "Description": "The Facebook group in question ( Stop The World, The Teabaggers Want Off ) almost exclusively publishes fabricated quotes attributed to Conservative politicians and pundits. Previously, Congresswoman Michele Bachmann , former Presidential candidate Mitt Romney , and Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson were targeted by the page with similar memes. Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin has also appeared in memes created by the page regarding white privilege , a purported endorsement of Benjamin Netanyahu, and a claim vaccinations lead to homosexuality. Stop The World, The Teabaggers Want Off generally attributes its quoted content to a well-known source (in this instance, Politico ), but the citations typically are bogus. A disclaimer found on the group's Facebook page states all posts are for entertainment purposes only: This page is for entertainment purposes. It is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It is primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages. Humorous memes are just one of several ways fake news and other shaky content spreads on the internet. Our article \" Six Ways to Spot Fake News illustrates many of the ways to spot (and avoid sharing) seemingly credible links that are in actuality humor-based..",
