  "Origins": "In August 2014 social media users began circulating a link to pages within the web site of Ralph Lauren clothiers which appeared to be offering for sale polo shirts described as being \"Nigger Brown\" in color:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "However, the links did not point to the genuine Ralph Lauren web site at ralphlauren.com , but rather directed users to ralph-lauren.us.com , a Chinese-registered domain which is unconnected to the real Ralph Lauren company and hosts a counterfeit site. An identical situation of a famous clothier being falsely connected with this same racial slur occurred in March 2012 when a Chinese-registered counterfeit Abercrombie & Fitch web site offered \"nigger brown\" pants for sale. A similar (and real) brouhaha also hit the Internet in 2007 when a Canadian retailer offered Chinese-made sofas for sale that, due to faulty translation software, were labeled as being \"nigger brown\" in color.",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, August 2014] A friend directed me to a web site: ralph-lauren.us.com for a ralph lauren outlet store to a mens brown shirt in the color \"niggerbrown\". I thought he was crazy, but sure enough there it was. Surely this is not an official Ralph Lauren website is it? I can't believe they would do such a thing or offer such a color. This has to be a cruel hoax.",
