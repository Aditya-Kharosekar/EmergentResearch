  "Origins": "On 8 November 2013, the National Report published an article positing that the state of Texas had passed a law allowing incarcerated sex offenders to be used as subjects for medical experimentation:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "By the following day links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, the article was just a bit of satire from the National Report , a web site that publishes outrageous fictional stories such as \"IRS Plans to Target Leprechauns Next,\" \"Boy Scouts Announce Boobs Merit Badge,\" and \"New CDC Study Indicates Pets of Gay Couples Worse at Sports, Better at Fashion Than Pets of Straight Couples.\" The National Report 's (since removed) disclaimer page notes: National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.",
