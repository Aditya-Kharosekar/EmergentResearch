Eyewitnesses say Woolery entered the Walmart store on Monday and approached the customer service desk for a return. Woolery complained that the Tampax Lites were causing her to leak and the cardboard applicator was just too rough for her woowoo and she wanted to exchange them for something else.",

  "Description": "Now8News doesn't include a disclaimer marking its content as fake news, and its layout could easily be mistaken for that of a regional news affiliate. However, the web site is has been the source of a number of outlandish, falsified claims. In July 2015 alone the site spread a fabricated tale about a man purportedly arrested for having sex with a pig in a Walmart bathroom, another claiming aborted fetuses were used in making Chicken McNuggets, and a third falsely reporting that bananas from Walmart were infested with parasitic worms. Moreover, the mug shot used by the site (purportedly taken following a 12 October 2015 arrest) appeared on a gallery of humorous arrest photos on The Smoking Gun. The individual depicted wasn't named, but the photo dated back to at least August 2010. Last updated: 16 October 2015 Originally published: 16 October 2015",
