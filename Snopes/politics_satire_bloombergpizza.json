  "Description": "By the end of the day links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news item. However, the article was just a bit of political humor from the Daily Currant , which was spoofing Bloomberg's efforts to limit the size of sugary drinks (such as sodas) to 16 ounces at restaurants, theaters and food carts in New York.
