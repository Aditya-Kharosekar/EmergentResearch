  "Example": "[Collected via Email, February 2016] There is a Facebook post circulating that claims it is a tweet from \"Bernie Sanders@SenSanders.\" The tweet says \"My goal is to dethrone God and destroy capitalism. True? Origin:On 31 January 2016, the Facebook group \"Tea Party Standup\" posted a fake photo purportedly showing a screenshot from Bernie Sanders' Twitter account: There is no record of this tweet appearing on Sanders' Twitter timeline. The above-displayed photo first started circulating in August 2015 and was most likely created by John Trulli, a Facebook user who frequently posts memes and fabricated tweets to his page. On 10 August 2015, Trulli shared the above-displayed image and a few days later he admitted that it was fake: It should also be noted that the quote, \"It is my objective in life to dethrone God and destroy capitalism,\" is frequently attributed to Karl Marx.
