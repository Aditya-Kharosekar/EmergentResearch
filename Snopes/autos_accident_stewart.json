  "Origins": "NASCAR champion Tony Stewart hit fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. at a race track in western New York state on 9 August 2014, fatally injuring Ward.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The two drivers had been involved in a minor collision moments earlier on the track at Canandaigua Motorsports Park, about 25 miles southeast of Rochester. During a sprint car race, Ward was spun out by Stewart, got out of his car to show his displeasure, and then was struck by Stewart's car, sending Ward sliding down the track. Video of the incident posted online showed that the 43-year-old Stewart, one of the biggest names on the NASCAR circuit, hit 20-year-old Ward when the latter approached Stewart's car on foot after the on-track incident: Ward was pronounced dead after being taken to a hospital in Canandaigua. Stewart was questioned and released by the Ontario County Sheriff's Office, and an investigation is ongoing. Stewart was in New York for the Cheez-It 355 NASCAR event the next day at Watkins Glen International but withdrew from the race.",
