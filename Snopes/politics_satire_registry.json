  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "By the end of the day links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news item. However, the article was just a bit of political humor from the Daily Currant that spoofed the multiple technical problems users encountered with the online federal health insurance exchange after that system was launched on the web at the beginning of October 2013. As noted in the Daily Currant 's \" About \" page, that web site deals strictly in satire: The Daily Currant is an English language online satirical newspaper that covers global politics, business, technology, entertainment, science, health and media. Q. Are your news stories real? A. No. Our stories are purely fictional. However they are meant to address real-world issues through satire and often refer and link to real events happening in the world.",
