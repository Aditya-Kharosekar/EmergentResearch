  "Origins": "We're aware (and have received many copies) of a series of three photographs showing Friends actresses Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox Arquette at the 9 April baptism of the latter's 10-month-old daughter, Coco, at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Birmingham, Alabama. The photos were purportedly forwarded to a friend via e-mail by Ms. Aniston (who is Coco's godmother). However, since the Arquettes have threatened to sue anyone who publishes them, we're not reproducing them here.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The Arquettes' proclamation does essentially answer the question of whether the photographs are genuine. The New York Daily News quotes Aniston's representative as claiming that the photos were not forwarded by the actress herself: . . . the digital pictures show Courteney Cox Arquette, hubby David Arquette and Brad Pitt's soon-to-be ex-wife, along with relatives and friends, smiling and holding Coco. Yesterday, one widely forwarded E-mail identified the sender as \"Jennifer Aniston.\" But her rep told Lowdown: \"They are not from Jennifer, and we believe they have been stolen from someone who attended the christening. The person who is sending them out pretending to be Jennifer is an imposter.\" Cox Arquette's rep didn't return a detailed message.",
