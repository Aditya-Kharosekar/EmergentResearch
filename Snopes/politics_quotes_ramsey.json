During that interview, when asked about the rumors of his garnering a reward for his actions, Ramsey proclaimed (if not quite as succinctly as quoted above) that he didn't feel like a hero and that since he already has a paycheck (which he produced from his pocket) any reward should go to the young women he helped rescue:",
