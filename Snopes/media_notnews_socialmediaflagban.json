  "Origins": "On 26 June 2015, the People of Lancaster web site published an article positing that several popular social media networks had announced they would be banning users who posted images of the Confederate flag:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Soon afterwards social media users were sharing links to the article as if it were real news many of them unaware of the irony that their shared posts themselves included images of the Confederate flag. Some of those readers may have encountered difficulty in verifying the validity of the story due to the fact that the People of Lancaster site apparently went down soon after this item was published (presumably due to an unexpected crush of traffic). In any case, no such prospective social media ban on Confederate flag images has been planned or announced, however: the article was just a bit of fake news from People of Lancaster , a site that openly tags such items as satire and states that they offer \"A satirical look at the people, places, and all things Lancaster County, PA.",
