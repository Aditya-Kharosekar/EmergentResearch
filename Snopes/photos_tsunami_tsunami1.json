  "Origins": "These photographs are yet another examples of any images depicting large waves being grabbed and passed around as \"real photographs\" of the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. These pictures were purportedly taken in Thailand in December 2004, but they actually date from 2002 and depict not a tsunami, but a tidal bore (unusually high tides resulting in waters flowing upstream at high speeds) on the Qian Tang Jiang River , in Hangzhou, China.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Tidal bores occur at predictable times, and watching these events is a four-day-long government-sponsored tourist festival in China, hence there were plenty of people and photographers on hand to observe the one captured in the pictures above. Several news outlets in a variety of countries have been taken in by these photos and have run them as genuine pictures of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.",
