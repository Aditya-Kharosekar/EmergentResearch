  "Origins": "On 19 December 2014, Daily Buzz Live published an article claiming McDonald's would be eliminating several popular offerings, including Big Macs, apple pies, and large size menu items:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, while McDonald's did announce in December 2014 that they were testing the idea of discontinuing some of their menu items (such as varieties of the Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Premium Chicken Sandwich, and Snack Wraps), favorites such as Big Macs, Apple Pies, and all large size menu items were not among the offerings potentially slated for the chopping block. The Daily Buzz Live article was just a bit of satire from that fake news site, which publishes made-up stories such as \"Starbucks Apologizes for Serving Satanic Coffee to Catholic Teacher,\" and \"Get Ready: Obama to Implement the New American Currency Called the ' Amero .'\" Daily Buzz Live 's disclaimer notes the site offers items that are not news, but rather fictional reports \"inspired\" by real events.",
