  "Origins": "On 29 August 2015, the Facebook page \"Fox News the FB Page\" published a photograph of Dr. Ben Carson (a former neurosurgeon seeking the Republican presidential nomination for 2016) alongside a purported quote about the benefits of slavery: Actually slavery was the best thing that could have happened to us. Because of slavery blacks were brought to America we met the Christian faith. We met Jesus Christ. If it were not for slavery we would all be in Africa,hanging from trees and worshiping Allah. God always get's it right!",
  "Fact Check": "Did Ben Carson say slavery was the \"best thing that could have happened\" to blacks?",
  "Description": "The quote bore passing resemblance to earlier comments made by Carson (such as a 2013 comment that Obamacare was \"the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\" and an op-ed penned by Carson in which he criticized Black Lives Matter protesters), but the words attributed to Dr. Carson were never spoken by him. Fox News The FB Page is a parody group that is not affiliated with Fox News Channel and primarily shares altered versions of current news stories or entirely fabricated content. Prior posts by that group include a claim that NASCAR was replacing their flag with a rainbow gay pride version and a faked news screenshot suggesting Donald Trump offered to pay legal fees for the dentist who killed Cecil the Lion.
