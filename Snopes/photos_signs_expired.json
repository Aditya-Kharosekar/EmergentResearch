  "Origins": "The above-displayed pictures do show the Okemah, Oklahoma, gravesite of one Barbara Sue Manire, who passed away on her 64th birthday in 2005 and is now interred at Highland Cemetery beneath a whimsical symbol of time expired: a parking meter with a \"64 year time limit.\" (Her headstone also bears the legend \"OUR MOM ... HER HUMOR LIVES ON.\")",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "As Barbara Sue's daughter, Sherri Ann Weeks, explained, the unusual decorative feature at the gravesite was indeed her mother's idea: Mom always said she wanted a parking meter with 'time expired.' And she wanted to be on the front row of the cemetery so she could see what was going on. We gave her what she wanted. The parking meter wasn't placed at the time Barbara Sue Manire was interred, however. Sherri and her brother, Terry Heiskill, mulled the matter over for about a year before the latter purchased a meter through eBay. A hole was drilled in the marble base at the burial site to accommodate the parking meter, which was given a coat of paint to match it with the gravestone. Sherri told us that the family \"are happy about the attention this [picture] has received because we know that our Mom is up above ... looking down and still laughing.\"",
