  "Example": "[Collected via Reddit, 2014] Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: Evil Mastermind Edition. Origin:An image purportedly showing a game show contestant on the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire quiz show being asked a confusing question concerning the first letter in the English alphabet has been circulating online since at least 2007. While the above-displayed screenshot was taken from an actual television show, the above image does not show a real question featured on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire game show. The above-displayed image actually comes from an Australian sketch comedy show called Comedy Inc: The Late Shift, which aired from 2005 to 2007 on the Nine Network: In addition to the obvious humor in the above-displayed clip, the video ends with a logo for The Late Shift and not the logo for Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.
