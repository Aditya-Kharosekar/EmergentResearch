  "Origins": "This item is another example of a common Internet phenomenon: Someone makes an image available on-line, the picture begins to circulate through e-mail forwards, the original attribution or explanation for the image gets lost along the way (or was never provided), people begin to make up stories to explain the origin of the now-sourceless picture, and those fabricated explanations become attached to the image as it continues to circulate. We've seen this phenomenon before in the maggot photographs ( disturbing image warning ), only in this case it isn't just the explanation that's fabricated; the image is a phony one created through digital manipulation as well.",

  "Description": "This image appeared on the Internet back in June 2003 (on a web site with a collection of other manipulated photographs); at that time it carried no explanation at all and was soon attributed by others to some new type of \"body modification.\" Not until a couple of months later did it pick up the story about an anthropologist named \"Susan McKinley\" who returned from a South American expedition to notice a \"very strange rash\" on her breast caused by \"larvae\" which were \"feeding off the fat, tissue, and even milk canals of her bosom.\" No known medical condition causes a result like the one depicted here, and the breast tissue around the supposed \"larvae infestation\" (larvae of what ?) is too healthy (no redness, inflammation, or necrosis) to be believable. This image appears to be the product of the melding of a photograph of a woman's breast and a picture of something similar to a lotus seed pod: In 2005 someone combined the picture and text quoted in the \"Example\" box above with an existing video clip that seemingly shows maggot-like creatures being removed by forceps from a woman's infected breast, and in November 2005 we began seeing versions that claimed the patient had developed her condition due to the flooding of New Orleans caused by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 My aunt, Head Nurse at Tulane Memorial hospital in New Orleans Louisianasent me this email. The attached video is that of a female patient who,due to the flooding of her home wore the same clothes for days. Thecontamination in the water was so bad she first broke out with a rash onher breast and then she had a lump on her breast and she popped it andpuss excreted from the lump. After treating it herself for days shefinally went to seek medical attention and when she did they foundserious infection! They later sedated the patient and found that theseinsects were within the fatty tissues of her breast and within the milkproducing glands (sorry not a TRUE medic), she is also 3 monthspregnant! And to think, we though Rita was bad on us! If you payattention you can see them moving in and out, gross, but one of theissues they are now dealing with in New Orleans with patients. This is a genuine video, but it has no connection to Hurricane Katrina. It shows the treatment of a Nigerian patient with breast lesions and multiple sinuses containing Tumbu fly larvae. (Fourteen separate larvae were eventually extracted from the breast.) The authors of a 2004 medical journal article on the case noted at the time that only \"one case has been reported in the English literature.\" In 2006, someone combined the following text with a series of photographs of patients experiencing what look like severe rashes, infections, and necrosis of the upper chest and breasts. The specific origins of these photos are unknown to us, but they likely depict the advanced stages of breast cancer. ( WARNING: Viewers may find the pictures displayed in this link disturbing.)",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, 2003] After anthropologist Susan McKinley came back home from an expedition in South America, she noticed a very strange rash on her left breast. Nobody knew what it was and she quickly dismissed it believing that the sores would leave in time. Upon her return she decided to see a doctor after she started developing intense pains. The doctor, not knowing the exact severity of the case, gave her antibiotics and special creams. As time elapsed the pain did not subside and her left breast became more inflamed and started to bleed. She decided to bandage her sores however as Susan's pain grew more intense she decided to seek help from a more certified doctor.Dr. Lynch could not diagnose the infection and told Susan to seek the aid of one of his colleagues who specialized in dermatology whom was sadly on vacation. She waited for two weeks and finally was able to reach the dermatologist. Sadly, a life changing event was about to unfold during her appointment. To Miss McKinley's surprise, after she removed the bandages, they found larva growing and squirming within the pores and sores of her breast. Sometimes these wicked creatures would all together simultaneously move around into different crevices. What she didn't know was that the holes were in fact, deeper than she had originally thought for these larvae were feeding off the fat, tissue, and even milk canals of her bosom. The holes were 5 cm deep. She was operated on and the larva was removed from her breast. Therefore always take a slight rash serious and have the eggs removed before it is to late. Cheers and may the creatures leave you in peace. [Collected via e-mail, 2005] Read the article first before looking at the picture and film. Thislooks horrible. Oh my God!!!!!!!
