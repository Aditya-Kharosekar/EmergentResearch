  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Post by Sector6. The video quickly went viral, but many viewers were skeptical of its authenticity, and the company's Facebook page filled with comments as people pondered the possibility of someone's surviving a parachuteless plummet from an airplane. Although many doubters debated the mathematics behind the stunt (e.g., the average velocity of a skydiver in a belly-to-earth free-fall position is 120 mph ), the video was easily debunked by pondering three non-scientific components: First, the video features a news clip from \"Sky Newz,\" which is not a real media organization. Second, the video just happens to end by promoting Sector 6's new trampoline park in New Orleans. Finally, Sector 6 uploaded the video with the title: \"This really happened at our California park,\" which is less than believable because Sector 6 has no facility in California. The truth is that this video is merely a clever advertisement for a new trampoline park.",
