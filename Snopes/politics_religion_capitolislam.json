  "Origins": "In his inaugural address in January 2009, incoming President Barack Obama said: To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. President Obama's words inspired Hassen Abdellah , an attorney who is the president of Dar UI Islam mosque in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to organize the staging of a prayer service at the U.S. Capitol, during which Muslims could pray \"for the soul of America.\" The Islam on Capitol Hill gathering is scheduled to take place on 25 September 2009, during which, the event's organizers advertise, the following will occur: The Athan will be chanted on Capitol Hill, echoing off of the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument and other great edifices that surround Capitol Hill. Thousands of Muslims from all races, creeds, colors and ethnicities will gather for the sole purpose of prayer. Bonds of friendship will be formed between those in attendance, both Muslims and Non-Muslims. Muslim youth will experience tours of the Library of Congress and the Supreme Court. The peace, beauty and solidarity of Islam will shine through America's capitol. Hassen Abdellah affirmed that no political events are planned in association with the gathering, and that everyone, not just Muslims, is welcome to attend:",

  "Description": "Contrary to claims made in some versions of this message, the referenced prayer service is not taking place at, nor has it been officially sanctioned by, the White House the Islam on Capitol Hill event is an independently organized one which will be held on public grounds at the West Front of the Capitol. (Also, although the White House did not host an ecumenical service on the National Day of Prayer in 2009 as it did in previous years, the observance of the National Day of Prayer itself was not cancelled.)",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, September 2009] On September 25th there will be a national prayer gathering of Muslims on the west front of the U.S. Capitol Building. They are expecting at least 50,000 to attend from mosques all across America. They say that they want America to see how they pray! A permit for this gathering was issued by Capitol Hill Police on July 28th. They will gather to pray from 4:00 AM until 7:00 PM. The gathering will take place by the site where U.S. Presidents have been inaugurated since 1981. The organizers say that it was Obama's inauguration speech in January and his speech broadcast from Egypt in June that gave them the idea for this prayer gathering on Capitol Hill. They have a wesite set up for this event. To view it go to: islamoncapitolhill.com. The site features a logo with a red, white and blue hand shaking a light brown hand with the words to the preamble to the Constitution and a page of Arabic text in the background. It is not yet known who will lead their main prayer service at 1:00 PM nor is it yet known who will preach the sermon. However, they have been working dilgently to raise money to televise the event. As I received this news, the Lord immediately brought back to mind the words that He spoke to me quite some time ago saying, \"I have strengthened Russia and China to come against America and Islam shall rise up from within America because the last three administrations have given Islam a seat of authority here in America.\" He has had me share this whereever He sent me to speak and no one really wanted to hear it. Nevertheless, it is here! It is happening! Russia and China have been testing America, and Islam is arising! These nations are but rods of judgment in the hands of Almighty God against our nation because we have turned our back on Him, His will, and His ways. Our nation has been given over to a false god with a false prophet at the helm. Dear Lord, in wrath remember mercy! If ever we needed to be crying out for mercy for America , it is now! We must stand strong and speak Truth whereever we are and at every given opportunity. We cannot be intimidated by the enemies of our God. Let us share the true Gospel of Yeshua the Messiah at every given opportunity. When the Great commission was given it was given to all of us, in America not just some of us. May there be multitudes come in to the Kingdom of God while there is yet time.",
