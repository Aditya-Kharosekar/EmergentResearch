  "Origins": "The Most Reverend Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, Auxiliary Bishop of New York, was an unassuming cleric who offered inspiration and instruction via his radio show, and then on a regular TV spot in the 1950s. From a studio mock-up of a study, complete with blackboard, he broadcast weekly lessons in life and morality on a show called \"Life Is Worth Living.\"",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "A common subject of Bishop Sheen's talks was the evils of communism, and one of his shows on this topic in early 1953 was long remembered because of an eerie coincidence. On that occasion, Bishop Sheen gave a dramatic reading of the burial scene from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, with the names of prominent Soviet leaders Stalin, Beria, Malenkov, and Vishinsky substituted for those of Caesar, Cassius, Marc Antony, and Brutus. From the Bishop's lips came the pronouncement, \"Stalin must one day meet his judgment.\" Stalin suffered a stroke a few days later and was dead within the week. Coincidence? Maybe. Maybe not.",
