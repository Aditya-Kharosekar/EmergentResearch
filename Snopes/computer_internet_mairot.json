  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "We haven't found any information confirming that a person named Thierry Mairot is (or was) contacting children through Facebook to engage them in sexual conversations, and had such activity been going on, given how long and how widely these warning messages have been circulating surely Facebook would have long since been alerted to the situation. This item appears similar in form to the long-running \" Social Deviants \" prank, in which the names of real persons are inserted into messages warning others against communicating with them via various social media.",
