  "Description": "In a closely contested vote, the FDA approved a new medical delivery device this week, the H-Vape 86. It is an Ativan air diffuser that looks like a Vicks Vaporub humidifier, yet it can do much more. The diffuser sits strategically in front of the charge RN of the floor, away from air return ducts. The potency of Ativan is regulated by a dial on the back of the diffuser. As tensions rise such as with yelling patients, high patient to nurse ratios, and patients who persistently press the call button every 5 minutes, the dial may be titrated to effect to produce a stronger vapor pressure. The approved model is equipped for any combination of medication, says [its inventor]. \"Haldol, Valium, you name it. It is customizable depending on the craziness of patients you have on your ward.\" The article included a purported quote from a nurse explaining how an ativan diffuser benefited patients and staff: Charge nurse, Greg Wilcox had this to say: \"The beauty is two fold. Patients seem to chill out significantly, but even if they don't, hospital staff's tolerance for stupidity increases, in effect making things run smoother. I plan to crank that diffuser way up on my nights, that's a promise!\" Gomer Blog 's (GOMER is an acronym for \"Get Out of My Emergency Room\") specialized brand of satire has occasionally escaped those who don't work in medicine, such as when an article poking fun at strict rules imposed upon nurses' stations circulated widely in October 2014.
