  "Example": "[Collected via Email, January 2016] This article says that a BBC newscaster said the weather was \"cold as fuck.\" It's hysterical, and it would be awesome if it was true. Is it? Origin:On 16 January 2016, the entertainment web site News Thump published a story claiming that BBC presenter Carol Kirkwood had described the weather as \"cold as f*ck\" during a live broadcast: The BBC has announced that there will be no punishment for popular weather presenter Carol Kirkwood s use of the phrase cold as f*ck. The BBC has issued a statement saying there would be no sanction for Miss Kirkwood because after investigation we have discovered that on the North York Moors on Friday morning, it was indeed cold as f*ck. There's no truth to the above-displayed story. News Thump is a satire publication that does not publish factual news stories: NewsThump is a satirical and spoof news website, taking a daily swipe at current affairs from the UK and around the world. We aim to be equal opportunity piss-takers and have no particular affiliation or political preference. It is our stated aim to mock absolutely everyone, eventually. Kirkwood caught wind of the story shortly after it was published. While the reporter didn't specifically mention the News Thump article, she did say that she definitely didn't say \"that\" during the broadcast: Last updated: 22 January 2016 Originally published: 22 January 2016",
