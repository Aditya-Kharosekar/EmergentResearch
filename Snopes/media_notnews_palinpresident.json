  "Origins": "On 16 March 2015, the entertainment Facebook page Stop The World, The Teabaggers Want To Get Off posted an image of Sarah Palin along with a fictitious quote ostensibly uttered by her about Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu becoming President of the United States:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "While the Facebook group alleged that Palin wrote the above-displayed quote on her website, a search on SarahPalin.com yeilded no results. The dubious diatribe was also missing from major news outlets. This is not surprising as the Facebook group Stop The World, The Teabaggers Want To Get Off frequently attributes fake quotes to real politicians. While the group mocks a wide range of political talking heads, Sarah Palin is clearly a favorite target. In November 2014, the group falsely claimed that Palin accused eskimos of being \"foreigners\" and in January 2015 the Facebook page posted an image of Palin along with an imaginary quote about white privilege.",
