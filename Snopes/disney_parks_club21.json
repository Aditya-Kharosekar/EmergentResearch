  "Origins": "No. you haven't been there, your friend hasn't been there, and none of your friend's friends has been there. Walt Disney World does not have a Club 21. There is a Club 21 (or 21 Club) at 21 West 52nd Street in New York, but when the Muppets took Manhattan, they didn't bring it back with them to Orlando.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Club 21 is part hoax and part confusion with the various corporate lounges found within the Magic Kingdom (one of which is indeed located near the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction). People mistake the rather modest lounges for private clubs on the scale of Disneyland's Club 33 .",
