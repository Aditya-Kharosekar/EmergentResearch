  "Example": "[Collected via Email, December 2015] Origin:On 22 December 2015, the web site Q Political published an article reporting that Republican candidate Donald Trump had dropped out of the 2016 Presidential race: Donald Trump has been dominating the polls for weeks and has shown no sign of slowing down in this Presidential race. So it came as a shock to everyone when he announced that he will be withdrawing from the race this week. \"I have never been a fan of politicians and just realized I was slowly becoming my own worst enemy. I'm dropping out of the race to leave a path for others to succeed since I am so awesome that nobody else could have stood a chance against me.\" While Q Political frequently publishes publishes articles misleading titles, the web site isn't specifically known as a satirical one, and therefore many readers may have missed the \"satire\" tag underneath the article reporting Trump's departure from the presidential race: In fact, not only has Donald Trump not announced his departure from the 2016 presidential race, he told the Washington Post in an interview published on on 9 December 2015 that he \"will never leave the race.\" Last updated: 22 December 2015 Originally published: 22 December 2015",
