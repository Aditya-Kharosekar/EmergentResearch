  "Origins": "This image purporting to be a coupon for the popular Chipotle Mexican Grill quick-service food chain promises \"100% free food\" at Chipotle restaurants through 20 March 2014 to those who repost it online. (How a local Chipotle outlet would know the presenting customer had reposted the coupon image before attempting to redeem it remains unexplained.)",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The offer is a hoax (probably created in the service of a Facebook \" like farming \" scam); the pictured coupon was not issued by Chipotle and will not be accepted at any of the chain's outlets. The company posted a notice to its Facebook page stating: There's no such thing as a free lunch or burrito for that matter. The \"repost, tag, and follow for FREE\" offer that is floating around the interwebs is A HOAX. Not real. Not from Chipotle. Chipotle also noted on Twitter that: Nope, 100% fake. It's a fake offer from a scam account.",
