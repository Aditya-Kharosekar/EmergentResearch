  "Origins": "In August 2015, social media users began sharing what appeared to be an article reporting the imminent closure of regional coffee chain Dutch Bros. Facebook shares included an embedded headline (\"Dutch Bros to close doors in 2016\") along with preview text that read: \"Popular Oregon coffee chain set to close doors next year, citing decline in sales.\" The \"news\" seemed to spread in part via users who shared the link on Facebook without clicking it, an action that led to the following image:",
