  "Origins": "Okay, boys and girls, how many \"hillbilly\" stereotypes can we spot in these pictures?",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "We have the pregnant, cigarette-smoking, sandal-shod bride with a NASCAR tattoo, and the mullet-headed, gap-toothed, beer-swilling groom clad in torn jeans and a plaid shirt, posing in front of a motor home and attended by a faithful Rottweiler, celebrating their wedding with a \"cake\" composed of Hostess brand Twinkies and Suzy Q cupcakes. That's eleven or twelve right there ... The picture of the bride and groom is an entry submitted to a Worth1000.com photo manipulation contest entitled \"If Rednecks Ruled.\" The actual photo from which the manipulated image was made was lifted from the online album of a couple who wed in August 2003. The picture of the cake is genuine (albeit unrelated to the first photo): It was taken from the Hostess web site, and it captures a couple who \"shared their Hostess happiness with guests\" by \"serving a three-tiered cake made of Twinkies and Cup Cakes\" at their December 2002 engagement party.",
