  "Origins": "In mid-October 2011, a survey scam purporting to offer free $50 or $100 Starbucks gift cards to those who followed particular links then did as told once there spread via e-mail and Facebook. Those who went in search of the promised freebies were asked to click what appeared to be Facebook \"share\" buttons and post comments to the scammer's site.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Those who followed such instructions were then led into a series of surveys they were instructed to complete before their gift cards could be sent to them. As always with such cons, there were no gift cards to be had. The \"Starbucks gift card\" con is a copy of the days-earlier Tim Horton survey scam, which itself was a clone of the survey scam falsely offering free Apple iPods, iPhones, or MacBooks in memory of Steve Jobs. Starbucks was founded in 1971, which does indeed make it 40 years old as of 2011. However, that's the only thing the e-mailed and Facebook-spread hoax had right.",
