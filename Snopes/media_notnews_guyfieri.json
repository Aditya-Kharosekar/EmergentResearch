  "Origins": "On 14 February 2015, the entertainment website Internet Chronicle published an article claiming that celebrity chef Guy Fieri had passed away:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "While the Internet Chronicle does not specifically label itself as an entertainment site, readers should be skeptical of any information coming from a publication that claims to be founded by a group of aliens who crash-landed on planet Earth in the 1970s: At the Chronicle.SU, we take truth seriously. We take what we do so seriusly, untruths at chronicle.su are punishable by mutilation or death. Sadly, chronicle.su is not of this earth. After crash landing in an asteroid December 30th, 1976, the alien husks of Chronicle editors rapidly adapted to Earth climates and bacterial flora. They are able to survive naturally in the wild and reproduce freely. Aside from the dubious origins of the entertainment web site that published this \"news,\" another clue is that no other media outlets have reported on Guy Fieri's supposed death. The celebrity chef has been active on social media in the days following his supposed death.",
