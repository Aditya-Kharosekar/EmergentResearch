  "Example": "[Collected via Email, December 2015] Is it true or false that Tommy Chong of Cheech and Chong is dead? Origin:On 15 December 2015, the web site Viral Time Lapse posted an article claiming that actor Tommy Chong, half of the Cheech and Chong comedy duo, had passed away: Actor Tommy Chong best known for his roles in That 70s Show or Cheech & Chong is dead. The article linked to a Facebook page and fans of the comedian were asked to show their condolences by commenting and liking the page: At about 11 p.m. ET on Thursday (December 17, 2015), our beloved actor Tommy Chong passed away. Tommy Chong was born on May 24, 1938 in Edmonton. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page. In addition to the fact that death announcements are rarely accompanied by a crass request to Like a Facebook page, Chong has taken to Twitter to proclaim his confirm status as a living human: While the story about Tommy Chong's death is obviously fake, it is true that the actor was diagnosed with rectal cancer and that he recently underwent an operation.
