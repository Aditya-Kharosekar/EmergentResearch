  "Origins": "In common English speech, \"hoity-toity\" is an adjective used with disdain to refer to the pretentious, those who put on a show of pretending to possess refinement and sophistication (similar to \"highfalutin\"). So, some people naturally assume that such an unusual expression, referring to the cultured, must itself have a cultured origin in this case a French-language reference to the (literal) upper class, people who looked down upon others from atop their high roofs (i.e., haut toit ).",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "\"Hoity-toity\" has nothing to do with French (or the French), however. The expression comes from our penchant for creating rhyming phrases such as \"loosey-goosey\" or \"helter-skelter,\" and in this case its base is \"hoit,\" an obsolete 16th century verb whose meaning is \"to play the fool\" or \"to indulge in riotous and noisy mirth.\" (\"Hoity-toity\" was more commonly used to describe those who engaged in thoughtlessly silly or frivolous behavior before it became more of a synonym for \"pretentious.\") Attempts to find the word \"haughty\" to be an ancestor of \"hoity-toity\" are equally specious.",
