  "Origins": "This request to honor the memory of a fallen U.S. Marine is correct in most of its brief particulars. U.S. Marine Corporal Derek A. Wyatt, of Akron, Ohio, a member of the U.S. 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine (\" Darkhorse \") Regiment, was killed in action in Afghanistan on 6 December 2010. News accounts from his home state reported that Cpl. Wyatt's wife Kait learned the tragic news of his loss just before giving birth to their son:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "(Although the Facebook appeal reproduced above states that Wyatt's newborn son was \"named in his honor,\" news accounts indicate that the couple had picked out the names Michael Everett for their child, matching neither the first nor middle name of his late father. Also, some news accounts refer to Derek Wyatt as a sergeant rather than a corporal.) An \"R.I.P. Derek Wyatt\" page dedicated to Corporal Wyatt's memory has been established on Facebook .",
