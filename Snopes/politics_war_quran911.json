  "Origins": "The chapter and verse citation reproduced in the example block above isn't a legitimate quotation from the Quran (or Koran), the sacred text of Islam no such passage appears in that book, at Chapter 9, Verse 11 or anywhere else.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "This item a hoax, a leg-pull , that plays on the USA's (i.e., the Eagle's) launching of military action against Afghanistan and Iraq (the \"lands of Allah\") in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks on America organized by Osama bin Laden (the \"son of Arabia\"). That the chapter and verse selection match the date of the terrorist attacks (9:11) is another giveaway to the joke. Depending upon which translation of the Quran one uses, the section corresponding to chapter 9, verse 11 actually reads something like this: But if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, they are your brethren in faith; and We make the communications clear for a people who know.",
