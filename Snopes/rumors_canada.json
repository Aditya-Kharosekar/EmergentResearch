  "Origins": "Jamie Symington's experiences in recent weeks may have demonstrated the truth of the maxim that \"no good deed goes unpunished.\"",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Symington, a 35-year-old officer with the Halifax, Nova Scotia, regional police service, drove to New York with a retired police dog named Trakr on September 11 after viewing horrible scenes of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on television. He and Trakr assisted with search-and-rescue efforts at the WTC site in New York, where Symington claimed to have helped locate one survivor. (The head of the New York City Police, however, has maintained that only five people were found alive in the rubble, none of them through the use of a dog.) One small problem: Symington, a 13-year veteran of the force, has been on medical leave since June with an elbow problem (and has also reported problems with job-related stress). He was spotted on television aiding rescue efforts in New York, and when he returned to Halifax, he was suspended from his position.",
