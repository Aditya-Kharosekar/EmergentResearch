  "Origins": "Some of the field sobriety tests that police are commonly portrayed as administering when they stop motorists suspected of DUI (driving under the influence) touching their fingers to their noses, walking a straight line heel-to-toe, standing on one leg can look a bit silly to outside observers, so it's not surprising that viewers who see this video clip out of context might wonder whether it really depicts a DUI stop captured by a camera mounted in a police cruiser.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "What gives some of those viewers pause, however, is the fact that the sobriety tests being administered to the cowboy-hatted DUI suspect by the female patrol officer in the video include tasks a good many of us couldn't do well (if at all) when perfectly sober, including rapidly reciting the alphabet backwards and duplicating some fairly intricate dance steps. Those are some indicators that the clip is indeed a spoof specifically, it's a segment taken from Reno 911! , a spoof of police television shows such as Cops that aired on Comedy Central from 2003 to 2009.",
