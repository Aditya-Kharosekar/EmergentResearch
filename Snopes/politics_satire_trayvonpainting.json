  "Origins": "George Zimmerman is the controversial figure who fatally shot an unarmed teenager named Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, on 26 February 2012 and was subsequently tried (and acquitted) on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. On 29 March 2014, the News Nerd web site published an article positing that Zimmerman had painted a portrait of Trayvon Martin with the words \"Justice for All\" included in the background and had sold it for $30,000 at an online auction:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The article included an image of a smiling Zimmerman holding the artwork (reproduced above), and soon afterwards many online viewers encountered that image, and a short explanation of its putative origins, stripped of their original context and mistook them for reporting of a genuine occurrence. However, the article and its image were fabrications, just part of a spoof from The News Nerd , whose site carries a disclaimer stating that all its material is satirical in nature: The stories posted on TheNewsNerd are for entertainment purposes only. The stories may mimic articles found in the headlines, but rest assured they are purely satirical. The News Nerd article spoofed (and used an altered photograph from) news accounts from December 2013 reporting that Zimmerman had sold a painting featuring a blue, waving American flag with the words, \"God, one nation, with liberty and justice for all\" emblazoned across it for over $100,000 on the eBay auction site:",
