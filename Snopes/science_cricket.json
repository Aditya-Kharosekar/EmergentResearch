  "Example": "Dr. Peggy LeMone of The GLOBE Program (a science education program funded by NASA, NOAA, NSF, and others) studied the theory during the summer of 2007 at her home in Boulder, Colorado, and posted her findings to her blog on 5 October 2007. Greatly simplifying her research, she found that when she counted the chirps during a 15 second span and then added 37 to that number, the resultant figure did closely approximate the actual air temperature (Graph 1). However, when she slightly adjusted the formula by recording chirp counts at 13 second intervals, then adding 40, the results even more closely adhered to the actual air temperature (Graph 2). Her findings (chirps in 13 seconds plus 40) confirms The Old Farmer's Almanac's wisdom (chirps in 14 seconds plus 40). Now, granted, this mode of determining the temperature will work only when there are crickets about. Also, it's accurate only down to 55 degrees Fahrenheit or so, because at lower temperatures crickets either aren't about or aren't in the mood for love.
