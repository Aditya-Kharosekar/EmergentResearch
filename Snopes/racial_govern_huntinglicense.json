  "Description": "this is a Nigger Hunting License for the State of Missouri. pic.twitter.com/lKjCGUUPvy trinimaican ; (@daniellamartin) October 28, 2014 The pictured license was not issued by the state of Missouri, nor did it provide the holder the legal right to hunt and kill African-Americans. It was a real piece of racist memorabilia, however, and it was reportedly sold at an annual party thrown by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) called \"The Good Ol' Boys Roundup.\" The text of the license read: Having paid the license fee is hereby licensed to hunt & kill NIGGERS during the open season hereof in the U.S. This license must be carried on person when hunting NIGGERS & gives the holder permission to hunt day or night, with or without dogs. In 1995, the Washington Times wrote an article detailing some of the racist behavior at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup. The article claimed vendors at the event sold T-shirts showing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the crosshairs of a rifle, as well as other racist memorabilia such as the aforementioned licenses. A video reportedly taken at the event by Jeff Randall of the Gadsden Minutemen also showed a \"Nigger Checkpoint\" sign and a \"No Blacks Allowed\" sign: The media attention given to this event prompted the Justice Department to open an investigation into the matter; and while investigators found evidence of \"shocking racist behavior,\" they could not prove racist hunting licenses had been sold at the event: Our investigation revealed ample evidence of shocking racist, licentious, and puerile behavior by attendees occurring in various years. For 1995, Randall contended that \"nigger hunting licenses\" were openly available on the Roundup campground. We found no evidence that such \"licenses\" were widely available at the Roundup; indeed, we found no one other than Randall who claimed to have seen one in the campground. The hunting licenses were apparently not sold at the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, according to the OIG report, and they were not legal documents issued by the state of Missouri. Still, these pieces of racist memorabilia really do exist; and at least one online store still sells \"authentic nigger hunting licenses.\" The Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia notes objects with racist themes continue to be created and vended in the United States: The battle continues. Objects with racist themes are created, produced, and sold weekly in the United States. In some instances, the objects (or images) are racially insensitive or demeaning in direct ways. In other cases, their racist meanings are more nuanced. The only redeeming value for all of these objects (and images) is that they can be used to teach tolerance and promote social justice.",
