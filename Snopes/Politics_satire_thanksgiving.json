  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Shortly afterward links and excerpts referencing that article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news item. However, the article was just a political spoof of Palin from the Free Wood Post , whose disclaimer notes that: Free Wood Post is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within FreeWoodPost.com are fiction, and presumably fake news.",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, November 2013] There is a picture of Sarah Palin going around on the internetwith a caption and dialogue of her saying that \"Thanksgiving is for realAmericans and not Indians and that if it weren't for the pilgrims, theIndians would still be running around in loincloths and feathers etc.\" I find it hard to believe she would say something like this as she ismarried to an Indian, an Alaskan Native to be exact.",
