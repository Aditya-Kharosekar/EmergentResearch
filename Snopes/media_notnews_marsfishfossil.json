  "Origins": "In November 2014, MSNBC.website published an article titled \"'Fish Fossil' Found by NASA's Mars Rover; 'Greatest Discovery' says NASA Scientists.\" In it, the site claimed images transmitted back from the craft definitively show a clear fish fossil image captured at the Windjana drilling site:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The article quoted \"Dr. Elle Stafon\" as saying the Mars fish fossil was the \"greatest discovery we've ever found.\" NASA's does have a Chief Scientist named Ellen Stofan , but the discovery to which she was purportedly speaking was totally fabricated, as was the comment attributed to her. The site from which it originated was not (as many were led to believe) MSNBC, but rather \"MSNBC.website,\" a fake news outlet with a deliberately misleading web address. The image of the \"Mars fish fossil\" is a doctored version of a real image taken by Curiosity, hosted at NASA's website : In the original unmanipulated photo, it's clear no fossil is present. MSNBC.website is one of a growing number of fake news websites spreading sensational, made-up stories on social media outlets including a recent death hoax involving actor Macaulay Culkin .",
