  "Origins": "This image of golden eagle taking a fox away from a partially-eaten, snowbound carcass is genuine, although it wasn't snapped by a \"hunter in Montana.\" It's one of a series of pictures taken by Finnish photographer Pekka Komi on 22 February 2006. The impression created by the full series of images is that the fox came upon the eagle while the latter was feeding on the carcass (and took exception to the intrusion), rather than the other way around",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "We do note that various videos available on the Internet demonstrate that a golden eagle can carry off a fox carcass, and that a (trained) bird of prey can prove a formidable foe to a live fox.",
