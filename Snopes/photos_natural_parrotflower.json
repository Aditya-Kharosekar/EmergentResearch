  "Origins": "Photographs of the \"parrot plant\" ( Impatiens psittacina ), which bears flowers whose shape and coloring are strikingly evocative of a parrot in flight, have been circulating and delighting viewers on the Internet since the mid-2000s. Although such pictures originally provoked much speculation that the plant did not exist and the images were digitally created composites, the \"parrot flower\" is indeed real and appears as pictured above, as noted by Ray Morgan in a 2007 article on the Impatiens genus published in The Plantsman:",
