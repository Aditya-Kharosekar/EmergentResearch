  "Origins": "This video clip purportedly showing school kids performing a stage version of Scarface , the 1983 Brian de Palma film starring Al Pacino as drug lord Tony Montana, raised hackles on the Internet in March 2010 among parents who were horrified that an elementary school would have children performing such inappropriate material full of adult themes, violence, and foul language (even if those elements were somewhat muted in the version shown here).",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "However, according to various sources (such as TMZ ), this video did not originate as a taped record of an elementary school play; the stage work was professionally produced and directed: That hysterical (or horrifying) version of \"Scarface\" making the rounds with grade school kids playing all the parts and spewing the f-word ... \"fudge\" yeah, it's not an actual school play. Instead, it's the work of director Marc Klasfeld and Rockhard Films who did the videos for Lady Gaga's \"Pokerface\" and Adam Lambert's \"For Your Entertainment.\" It was produced in L.A. within the last few weeks and the audience members were a mix of cast family members, colleagues and friends. As for Lil' Tony and his co-stars, they were selected through a casting agent known for finding child actor look-alikes for adult stars. And according to the Los Angeles Times : The video was actually made [in February 2010] with professional child actors in a rented theater in Koreatown and directed by Marc Klasfeld, a veteran music video director. With the quirky homage to \"Scarface,\" Klasfeld said \"we had a great cast, great kids and great parents ... they enjoyed the process.\" The director said it was amusing to watch the pockets of outrage as the purposely provocative video spread out across the Internet. \"We definitely suspected that would happen,\" said Klasfeld, a father of two who says he wonders why the most vocal critics of the ironic video don't speak out more against the sexualization of young girls in American culture or the relentless violence on screens of all sorts. \"Everyday when I wake up with my daughter and I turn on the television for her and we're constantly guarding her against all these unnecessary sexual [messages] bombarding her ... so for us to see the reaction against this, well, that was a little shocking,\" Klasfeld said. \"I found it all fascinating.\"",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, March 2010] Is this story and the art real? He lived at Rose Haven Nursing Home (Roseburg, OR) for years. Paul Smith, the man with extraordinary talent was born in Philadelphia on September 21, 1921, with severe cerebral palsy. Not only had Paul beaten the odds of a life with spastic cerebral palsy, a disability that impeded his speech and mobility but also taught himself to become a master artist as well as a terrific chess player even after being devoid of a formal education as a child. When typing, Paul used his left hand to steady his right one. Since he couldn't press two keys at the same time, he almost always locked the shift key down and made his pictures using the symbols at the top of the number keys. In other words, his pictures were based on these characters ..... @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ . Across seven decades, Paul created hundreds of pictures. He often gave the originals away. Sometimes, but not always, he kept or received a copy for his own records. As his mastery of the typewriter grew, he developed techniques to create shadings, colors, and textures that made his work resemble pencil or charcoal drawings. This great man passed away on June 25, 2007, but left behind a collection of his amazing artwork that will be an inspiration for many. Can you believe these were done on a typewriter?",
