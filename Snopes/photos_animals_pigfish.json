  "Origins": "The image displayed above has been circulated via social media with accompanying text variously describing it as showing a \"pigfish,\" a \" pig-nose fish ,\" and a \"wild hogfish,\" a type of fish supposedly found in locales ranging from Arkansas to Texas to South Africa.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Although there is a taxonomic family of fish ( Congiopodidae ) collectively known as pigfish and at least one species of fish called a hogfish , none of them exhibits the distinctive porcine ears and snout shown in this picture. In fact, this image is simply a digitally manipulated version of an ordinary photograph of a rather common and visually unremarkable type of fish:",

  "Example": "[Collected via Facebook, March 2014] A new species of fish has been discovered in Texas creeks. It's know as the Wild Hogfish and can be extremely aggressive, and their numbers are increasing like crazy. Very tasty, a little like bacon, they are good eatin'. Once reintroduced domestically, they become goldfish. This 'pig-nose fish', was found in the dam of Clanwilliam, flowing waters of the Burg Rivers of Cape Town, South Africa. I have never seen one of these critters but doubt it that it would be kosher or halaal. Amazing new fish discovered in Arkansas.",
