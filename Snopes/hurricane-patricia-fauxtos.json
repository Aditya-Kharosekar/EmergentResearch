  "Origins": "As Hurricane Patricia made its way toward Mexico in October 2015, social media users started sharing several fake photographs purportedly showing the record-breaking storm specifically, the above-displayed images, which were taken by NASA but do not show Hurricane Patricia. These images were actually taken in March 2015 and show Typhoon Maysak: Typhoon Maysak strengthened into a super typhoon on March 31, reaching Category 5 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale. ESA Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti captured this image while flying over the weather system on board the International Space Station.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Several other images purportedly showing Hurricane Patricia were also passed around the Internet: Again, neither of these photographs was taken in 2015 nor captures Hurricane Patricia. The left-hand portion of the above-displayed image was taken from the 2004 movie The Day After Tomorrow. The sequence can be glimpsed in the trailer embedded below around the 50-second mark: The other portion of the image does show a natural occurrence, but one that is unrelated to Hurricane Patricia. That image was taken of a waterspout near Oldsmar, Florida, that appeared in July 2013. Last updated: 24 October 2015",
