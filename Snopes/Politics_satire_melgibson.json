However, that article was just a bit of political humor which satirized Mel Gibson's history of anti-semitic comments and outbursts. (For the record, Mel Gibson has no daughter named Mary-Catherine Regina: his two daughters, one by his ex-wife Robyn and one by Russian pianist Oksana Grigorieva, are named Hannah and Lucia.)
