  "Origins": "The 19 January 2013 Borowitz Report column in The New Yorker opened with the following item about the Fox News channel's plans to shut down for routine maintenance on the upcoming Monday:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "For those who didn't see this piece in its original context (which, based on the number of inquiries we've received about it, appears to be a substantial number of readers), we note that The Borowitz Report is the product of humorist Andy Borowitz, whose columns regularly satirize political figures and issues. In this case the basis of the joke is that the referenced date for a putative shutdown of the Fox News Channel is far from a day on which \"nothing will be happening\": Monday, 21 January 2013 at 11:30 E.T. is the date and time of the inaugural ceremony at which Barack Obama will be sworn in for a second term as President of the United States, an event which will be covered live by a number of different U.S. television networks and cable channels.",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, January 2013] Heard a rumor that Fox networks will not broadcast on Monday, January 21, because \"there is nothing of interest to their viewers that day\". They will be doing technical work and will resume broadcasting on January 22. Is this true?",
