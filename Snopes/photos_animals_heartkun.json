  "Origins": "What could be cuter than a puppy? How about a puppy with a heart-shaped marking on his coat? (Or, more specifically, a puppy with a marking that resembles the way a heart is typically rendered in popular culture.)",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Such a critter was born in the northern Japanese city of Odate in May 2007, part of a litter raised by breeder Emiko Sakurada. The little fellow, a long-coated chihuahua dubbed \"Heart-kun,\" came into the world with a perfect heart-shaped pattern in his fur. Ms. Sakurada said that she had never seen a similar marking on the approximately 1,000 other puppies that she had bred, and that she had no plans to sell Heart-kun, who has \"brought good fortune\" to her and everyone who crosses his path. This short video clip provides some glimpses of Heart-kun and Emiko: In August 2009, Heart-kun's mother gave birth to a litter of four puppies, one of which, like his older brother, also bears a distinctive heart-shaped marking on its coat. Emiko named this little fellow Love-kun:",
