  "Origins": "This item doesn't really offer any specific falsifiable claims other than the claim that the above-reproduced personality test was created, proffered, or endorsed, by Dr. Phil. That claim is false: Although popular psychologist Dr. Phillip C. McGraw (better known to millions of television viewers as \"Dr. Phil\") appeared as a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show many times between 1998 and 2002 before becoming the host of his own nationally syndicated Dr. Phil television show in 2002, we found no evidence (by reviewing program listings and transcripts) that he ever offered the test shown above on either program. On his show of 25 November 2009, Dr. Phil ranked personality tests as #1 on his list of the top five Internet-promoted items that have misappropriated his name, telling his audience, \"I don't have a personality test.\" The test antedates Dr. Phil's first guest spot on The Oprah Winfrey Show by many years, having been published as far back as 1987 (with a 1978 copyright), when it was attributed to a \"Dr. Charles Vine.\" Who is Dr. Charles Vine? We don't know the only references to that name we've found are bylines crediting him as the author of this test.",

  "Description": "Is this a \"real\" personality test? It might be in the vaguely general sense that one can make some very broad generalizations about personality types based upon the way people say they stand, walk, work, interact with others, etc., and be right somewhat more often than random chance would dictate, perhaps. But this test is far more of a parlor trick best used for nothing more than entertainment purposes real clinical psychological tests (i.e., the kind \"folks pay a lot of money\" for, such as the MMPI ) are much more complex, more varied, and longer, and their scoring methods and interpretations are not publicly disclosed in order to maintain their viability. The best way to regard this test is to consider it similar to a horoscope or a fortune cookie: all of them make broad, general predictions which could seemingly apply to a great many people. The skeptical dismiss such predictions as random shots that occasionally hit their marks (in the same way that a stopped clock is right twice a day); the credulous marvel over their accuracy, find ways to make the results apply to themselves, and overlook the parts that don't fit.",

OVER 60 POINTS: Others see you as someone the should \"handle with care\". You're seen as vain, self-centered, and who is extremely dominant. Others may admire you, wishing they could be more like you, but don't always trust you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you. 51 TO 60 POINTS: Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure. They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement your radiate. 41 TO 50 POINTS: Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out. 31 TO 40 POINTS: Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful & practical. They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest. Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken. 21 TO 30 POINTS: Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder. It'd really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then, usually decide against it. They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature. UNDER 21 POINTS: People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive, someone who needs looking after, who always wants someone else to make the decisions & who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything. They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that don't exist. Some people think you're boring. Only those who know you well know that you aren't. Now forward this to others, and put your score in subject box.",
