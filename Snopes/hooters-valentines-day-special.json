  "Example": "[Collected via Email, January 2016] I saw this on facebook and wanted to find out if this was true. It says on Valentine's Day you can bring in a picture of your ex to shred to Hooters and get 10 free boneless wings. Origin:In January 2016, an image purportedly showing an advertisement for the Hooters restaurant chain that promised ten free boneless wings for patrons who bring in pictures of their former partners on Valentine's Day began getting passed via social media: The post gathered thousands of shares before Hooters finally chimed in to confirm that the promotion was real: The restaurant has also been responding to doubtful customers on social media: Although many consumers were skeptical about the \"Shred Your Ex\" promotion, this isn't the first time that Hooters has invited customers to shred photos of their exes in exchange for wings on Valentine's Day. According to Eater, the restaurant chain has been running similar promotions since at least 2011. Last updated: 29 January 2016 Originally published: 29 January 2016",
