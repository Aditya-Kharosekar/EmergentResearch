  "Origins": "On 16 March 2015, the Facebook entertainment page Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want Off posted an image of Sarah Palin along with a quote ostensibly uttered by her about Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu becoming President of the United States:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "While the meme suggested that Palin published the above-displayed quote on her web site, a search of SarahPalin.com yielded no such results. The dubious diatribe was also missing from major news outlets. This is not surprising as the Facebook group Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want Off is a satirical site that frequently attributes fake quotes to real politicians. While the group mocks a wide range of political talking heads, Sarah Palin is a favorite target of theirs. Similar images posted to the group have portrayed fictitious quotes from Palin that accused eskimos of being \"foreigners\" and decried \"black privilege.\" For the record, Benjamin Netanyahu is a native-born citizen of Israel and therefore would be ineligible for election as President of the United States.",
