  "Origins": "In August 2015, a video claiming that episodes of the Fox animated series The Simpsons had made some eerily accurate predictions about future events began circulating via social media. Most notable among those predictions was a clip purportedly taken from a 2000 episode that showed business magnate Donald Trump running for President of the United States:",
  "Fact Check": "Does a video show that The Simpsons predicted in 2000 that Donald Trump would run for president in 2015?",
  "Description": "I want people to realize the synchronicity here and all the connections. This was put out in 2000. Fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago. Now this is happening. While the above-displayed video touches on a wide variety of Simpsons related conspiracy theories, the main issue was highlighted in September 2015 with a photograph one that not only documented that The Simpsons had depicted Donald Trump running for President back in 2000, but they did so by showing him in a setting and pose (riding an escalator while waving to supporters and onlookers) identical to one he would assume fifteen years later: The images from The Simpsons shown on the left-hand side of the above-displayed graphic did not originate in 2000, however. They were taken from a short video entitled \"Trumpastic Voyage\" which was posted to the \"Animation Domination\" YouTube channel page on 7 July 2015, after Trump had announced that he would be seeking the Republican presidential nomination for 2016: The animated series did feature a joke about Donald Trump's becoming president in a 2000 episode entitled \"Bart to the Future,\" but since Trump has been flirting with the idea of making a presidential run since at least as far back as 1999, such a \"prediction\" wasn't as prescient as it might seem in retrospect: Last updated: 24 September 2015",
