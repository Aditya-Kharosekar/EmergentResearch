  "Origins": "Squalene is natural organic compound produced by all higher organisms (including human beings). Squalene is sometimes used as an adjuvant in vaccines that is, an agent that stimulates the immune system and increases the response to a vaccine. The warning reproduced above cautions that the swine flu vaccine \"is one of the most dangerous vaccines ever devised\" because it uses squalene as an adjuvant, and vaccines containing squalene have been proved to cause severe autoimmune disorders. It is wrong on both counts.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The claim that vaccines containing squalene have been linked to severe autoimmune disorders is based on a study published in the journal Experimental and Molecular Pathology in 2000 which found squalene antibodies in Gulf War veterans who had received anthrax vaccines before being deployed. However, as noted by the World Health Organization ( WHO ), that study has been criticized as flawed for a number of reasons, not least of which is that the anthrax vaccines administered to the subjects of the study did not contain squalene: A few people have tried to link the health problems of Gulf War veterans to the possible presence of squalene in the vaccines these soldiers received. One published report suggested that some veterans who received anthrax vaccines developed anti-squalene antibodies and these antibodies caused disabilities. It is now known that squalene was not added to the vaccines administered to these veterans, and technical deficiencies in the report suggesting an association have been published. Most adults, whether or not they have received vaccines containing squalene, have antibodies against squalene. In any case, the squalene issue is a moot point, because the flu vaccines being distributed in the U.S. do not contain squalene. There are currently no vaccines approved for use in the U.S. with a squalene adjuvant, and neither the current swine flu nor the seasonal flu vaccines has any adjuvant at all. A complete list of vaccines (and their component ingredients) licensed for immunization and distribution in the U.S. is available on the web site of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), and it shows that none of the approved flu vaccines contain squalene.",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, September 2009] An outbreak of swine flu occurred in Mexico this spring that eventually affected 4,910 Mexican citizens and resulted in 85 deaths. By the time it spread to the United States, the virus caused only mild cases of flu-like illness. Thanks to air travel and the failure of public health officials to control travel from Mexico, the virus spread worldwide. Despite predictions of massive numbers of deaths and the arrival of doomsday, the virus has remained a relatively mild disease, something we know happens each year with flu epidemics. Worldwide, there have only been 311 deaths out of 70,893 cases of swine flu. In the United States, 27,717 cases have resulted in 127 deaths. Every death is a tragedy, but such a low death rate should not be the basis of a draconian government policy. It is helpful to recall that the Centers for Disease Control with the collusion of the media, constantly tell us that 36,000 people die from the flu each year, a figure that has been shown to be a lie. In this case, we are talking about 300 plus deaths for the entire world. This virus continues to be an enigma for virologists. In the April 30, 2009 issue of Nature, a virologist was quoted as saying, \"Where the hell it got all these genes from we don t know.\" Extensive analysis of the virus found that it contained the original 1918 H1N1 flu virus, the avian flu virus (bird flu), and two new H3N2 virus genes from Eurasia. Debate continues over the possibility that swine flu is a genetically engineered virus. Naturally, vaccine manufacturers have been in a competitive battle to produce the first vaccine. The main contenders have been Baxter Pharmaceuticals and Novartis Pharmaceuticals, the latter of which recently acquired the scandal-ridden Chiron vaccine company. Both of these companies have had agreements with the World Health Organization to produce a pandemic vaccine. The Baxter vaccine, called Celvapan, has had fast track approval. It uses a new vero cell technology, which utilizes cultured cells from the African green monkey. This same animal tissue transmits a number of vaccine-contaminating viruses, including the HIV virus. The Baxter company has been associated with two deadly scandals. The first event occurred in 2006 when hemophiliac components were contaminated with HIV virus and injected in tens of thousands of people, including thousands of children. Baxter continued to release the HIV contaminated vaccine even after the contamination was known. The second event occurred recently when it was discovered that Baxter had released a seasonal flu vaccine containing the bird flu virus, which would have produced a real world pandemic, to 18 countries. Fortunately, astute lab workers in the Czech Republic discovered the deadly combination and blew the whistle before a worldwide disaster was unleashed. Despite these two deadly events, WHO maintains an agreement with Baxter Pharmaceuticals to produce the world s pandemic vaccine. Novartis, the second contender, also has an agreement with WHO for a pandemic vaccine. Novartis appears to have won the contract, since their vaccine is near completion. What is terrifying is that these pandemic vaccines contain ingredients, called immune adjuvants that a number of studies have shown cause devastating autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and lupus. Animal studies using this adjuvant have found them to be deadly. A study using 14 guinea pigs found that when they were injected with the special adjuvant, only one animal survived. A repeat of the study found the same deadly outcome. So, what is this deadly ingredient? It is called squalene, a type of oil. The Chiron company, maker of the deadly anthrax vaccine, makes an adjuvant called MF-59 which contains two main ingredients of concern squalene and gp120. A number of studies have shown that squalene can trigger all of the above-mentioned autoimmune diseases when injected. The MF-59 adjuvant has been used in several vaccines. These vaccines, including tetanus and diphtheria, are the same vaccines frequently associated with adverse reactions. I reviewed a number of studies on this adjuvant and found something quite interesting. Several studies done on human test subjects found MF-59 to be a very safe immune adjuvant. But when I checked to see who did these studies, I found to no surprise that they were done by the Novartis Pharmaceutical Company and Chiron Pharmaceutical Company, which have merged. They were all published in prestigious medical journals. Also, to no surprise, a great number of studies done by independent laboratories and research institutions all found a strong link between MF-59 and autoimmune diseases. Squalene in vaccines has been strongly linked to the Gulf War Syndrome. On August 1991, Anthony Principi, Secretary of Veterans Affairs admitted that soldiers vaccinated with the anthrax vaccine from 1990 to 1991 had an increased risk of 200 percent in developing the deadly disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also called Lou Gehrig s disease. The soldiers also suffered from a number of debilitating and life-shortening diseases, such as polyarteritis nodosa, multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus, transverse myelitis (a neurological disorder caused by inflammation of the spinal cord), endocarditis (inflammation of the heart s inner lining), optic neuritis with blindness and glomerulonephritis (a type of kidney disease). Because squalene, the main ingredient in MF-59, can induce hyperimmune responses and induce autoimmunity, a real danger exists for prolonged activation of the brain s immune cells, the microglia. This type of prolonged activation has been strongly associated with such diseases as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer s disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS and possibly vaccine-related encephalitis. It has been shown that activation of the systemic immune system, as occurs with vaccination, rapidly activates the brain s microglia at the same time, and this brain inflammation can persist for long periods. So, how would the gp120 get into the brain? Studies of other immune adjuvants using careful tracer techniques have shown that they routinely enter the brain following vaccination. What most people do not know, even the doctors who recommend the vaccines, is that most such studies by pharmaceutical companies observe the patients for only one to two weeks following vaccination these types of reactions may take months or even years to manifest. It is obvious that the vaccine manufacturers stand to make billions of dollars in profits from this WHO/government-promoted pandemic. Novartis, the maker of the new pandemic vaccine, recently announced that they would not give free vaccines to impoverished nations everybody pays. One must keep in mind that once the vaccine is injected, there is little you can do to protect yourself at least by conventional medicine. It will mean a lifetime of crippling illness and early death. There are much safer ways to protect oneself from this flu virus, such as higher doses of vitamin D3, selective immune enhancement using supplements, and a good diet.",
