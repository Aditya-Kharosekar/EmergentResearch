  "Example": "[Collected via Tumblr, October 2015] Origin:In December 2015, a photograph of Hillary Clinton, along with a quote ostensibly uttered by her about the intelligence of Democratic voters, started making the social media rounds: Look, the average Democrat voter is just plain stupid. They're easy to manipulate. That's the easy part. The above-displayed message was not uttered by Hillary Clinton and was not published in the 2005 book Rewriting History by Dick Morris. We found no record of the quote in any major publication. In fact, the first mention of this quote came in October 2015, more than a decade after Morris' book was published, on a Tumblr page dedicated to generating fake Hillary Clinton quotes: The \"Shocking Hillary Clinton quotes...\" Tumblr page claims that all of its links are \"100% verified,\" but we reviewed a handful of memes posted to the page and found all of them to be completely fictional. While the web site does provide links to make its material seem more credible, these links never direct readers to the actual source of the quote. The \"Shocking Hillary Clinton quotes...\" Tumblr page is just another fake quote generator created in the same vein as the \"Stop The World, The Teabaggers Want Off\" Facebook group.
