  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The article's horrible formatting and nonsensical reasoning alone should be enough to tip off readers that Huzlers is one of several fake news sites that promotes fantastically fictional clickbait stories to attain traffic through social media shares. Previous Huzlers hoaxes included Justin Bieber's coming out as bisexual and claims that the 2014 Super Bowl was rigged. The Huzlers site displays a disclaimer on its pages noting \"Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satire news to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief.\"",
