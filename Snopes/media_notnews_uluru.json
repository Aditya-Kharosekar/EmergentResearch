  "Origins": "On 7 September 2014, the World News Daily Report web site published an article positing that the remains of a hitherto unknown ancient city had been discovered in the Australian desert:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this item were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, that article was just another spoof from World News Daily Report , a fake news web site whose stock in trade is publishing fantastically fictional stories. The site's disclaimer page states that: World News Daily Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within worldnewsdailyreport.com are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental, except for all references to politicians and/or celebrities, in which case they are based on real people, but still based almost entirely in fiction.",
