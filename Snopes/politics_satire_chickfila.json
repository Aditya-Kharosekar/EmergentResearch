  "Origins": "In August 2012, the Chick-fil-A chain of quick-service chicken restaurants announced it had experienced a record-setting sales day after supporters staged a \"Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day\" in response to calls for a boycott of the chain due to a recent controversy over Chick-fil-A president Dan Cathy s opposition to gay marriage. Shortly afterwards, the Free Wood Post published an article positing that Cathy was planning to announce that the chain \"doesn't like blacks either\" as a marketing plot to stir up more controversy and boost sales:",

All news articles contained within FreeWoodPost.com are fiction, and presumably fake news.",
