  "Origins": "The photographs shown above were taken at the Royal Wedding of HRH Prince William and Kate Middleton in April 2011, and they have been juxtaposed with images from Disney's classic 1950 animated version of Cinderella to highlight the remarkable visual similarities between the real-life wedding and its fairy tale counterpart.",

  "Description": "However, art and life didn't match up quite so neatly in this case at least, not without the help of some digital manipulation. In this case, though, the photographs are genuine and untouched; it's what they're being compared to that has been altered. The Royal Wedding photographs only appear to match up so well with similar scenes from Disney's Cinderella because the colors of clothing and hair shown in the original animated frames have been changed to make them appear more like scenes from the real-life wedding. In this pairing, the colors of the prince's outfit and Cinderella's hair color have been altered to match those of Prince William and Kate Middleton: In this set, the dress and hair colors of Cinderella's two vain step-sisters have been altered to match those of the Prince William's cousins, Princess Beatrice of York (the blonde wearing pink) and Princess Eugenie of York (the brunette wearing blue), both of whom are daughters of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson,",
