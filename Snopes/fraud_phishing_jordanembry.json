  "Origins": "On 6 April 2015, a message started circulating around Facebook that a man named Jordan Embry was giving away thousands of dollars to people who liked his Facebook page:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Although thousands of people have followed Embry's instructions and liked, commented, and shared his Facebook message, those people should not expect to receive any money from Jordan Embry, as the above-displayed post is merely part of a \"like farming\" scam: These posts work by slowly gathering likes for a Facebook page, usually full of innocent content like famous quotes or photos. However, the true purpose of these pages is often to gain enough traction in Facebook\u0019s algorithm to begin appearing in users\u0019 news feeds. The owners of the page can then post advertising and links that reach a much wider audience because of the groundwork they\u0019ve laid by collecting likes. They can link to whatever products or sites they wish, including products that they may receive a commission on or identity-stealing malware. Scammers have also established fake celebrity pages and phony car giveaway promotions in order to gain exposure on Facebook.",
