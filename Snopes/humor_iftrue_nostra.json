  "Origins": "Yuk yuk. Nostradamus wrote a lot of stuff so general (and obscure) that with the help of a little imagination (and some liberal interpretations from the original French), people have claimed he has \"predicted\" nearly every event of significance since the mid-16th century. But nothing in his writings comes close to the quatrain quoted above, even when translated by a first-year French student. This is just another bit of election year humor that popped up in 2000.",
