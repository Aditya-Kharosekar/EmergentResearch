  "Origins": "The picture displayed above is reminiscent of the Crushin' Roulette legend (two collided trucks are pulled apart weeks later, and a small car is found to have been crushed between them); and although its circumstances may not mirror the substance of that legend, it's close enough that many viewers have found the photograph both fascinating and chilling.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "According to information from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office and various readers, the accident pictured above took place in May 2009 in Harvey, Louisiana, and involved a Ford Escape SUV, not (as is commonly reported) the smaller Smart Car. The impact did not occur dead center as apparently shown in the photograph: it was offset to the right, and thus the driver's side was not nearly as heavily damaged. The driver of the Ford survived the crash and has since been released from the hospital. A reader who told us he was present at the scene of the accident said that (although it is not visible in this photograph) a second vehicle was between the Ford SUV and the dump truck at the time of the collision but was knocked onto the grass underneath the elevated roadway, and that any vehicle \"short of another dump truck\" would have suffered the same crumpled fate as the Ford did.",
