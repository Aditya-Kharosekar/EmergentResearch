  "Example": "[Collected via Email, December 2015] I saw a post that the Legal drinking age will be raised to 23 in February of 2016. Is it true? Origin:On 9 December 2015, a message claiming that the legal drinking age would be raised to 23 in February 2016 started circulating on Facebook: While the above-displayed Facebook message may appear at first glance as if it came from the news network CNN, that is not the case. This Facebook message was created by a prank website that creates links which resemble real news stories. However, when a user clicks on the link they are redirected to a page that informs them that the story was fake: Users are then prompted to share the joke with their friends on Facebook. Similar pranks have previously circulated on the internet, briefly convincing Facebook users that Taco Bell was closing and that PepsiCo was discontinuing Mountain Dew.
