  "Description": "By the end of the day links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news item. However, the article was just a bit of political humor from the Daily Currant which spoofed the Hobby Lobby's challenge to the federal mandate requiring them to provide health insurance with contraceptive coverage female employees, on the grounds that doing so would violate the company's closely held Christian beliefs. As noted in the Daily Currant 's \" About \" page, that web site deals strictly in satire: The Daily Currant is an English language online satirical newspaper that covers global politics, business, technology, entertainment, science, health and media.
