  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "While many readers took the claim at face value and subsequently shared and republished it, the article was just a bit of fiction from World News Daily Report , whose disclaimer page states: World News Daily Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within worldnewsdailyreport.com are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental, except for all references to politicians and/or celebrities, in which case they are based on real people, but still based almost entirely in fiction. World News Daily Report 's prior fake news articles includes a widely shared story about an eyewitness account to Jesus' miracles , another claiming loggers mistakenly cut down the world's oldest tree , and a hoax involving a \"prehistoric shark \" purportedly discovered in Pakistan.",
