  "Origins": "Familiar advertisements are commonly used as platforms for humor, as exemplified by the take-off on a print advertisement for Heineken brand beer displayed above. It isn't a real advertisement, but a spoof that plays on the brouhaha over media portrayals of looters in New Orleans in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and on the stereotype of blacks' eschewing (or being unable to afford) \"regular\" alcohol such as beer in favor of cheap malt liquor brands such as Colt 45 and Red Dog.",
