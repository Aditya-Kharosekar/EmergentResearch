  "Origins": "Echoing a line from President Bush's 2002 State of the Union address in which he referred to states such as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea (and their terrorist allies) as an \"axis of evil,\" this bit of political satire plays on the humor of a jealous Libya, China, and Syria forming an \"axis of just as evil.\" Unlike his fellow Monty Python member Terry Jones , however, John Cleese isn't penning political articles about the current situation with Iraq this piece comes from the archives of SatireWire .",
