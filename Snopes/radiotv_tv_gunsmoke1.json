  "Origins": "Huh? Einstein on Gunsmoke ? You've got to be kidding.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "One \"P.B.\" of Webster, Massachusetts, wasn't kidding, for in 1994 he wrote to TV Guide to inquire whether it was true that the famed physicist had once guest-starred on television's longest-running western. If we were to take this seriously, we'd have to point out that it would have been impossible for Einstein to have appeared on Gunsmoke , as the world-famous scientist passed away on 18 April 1955, before the show (which premiered on 10 September 1955) went into production. He could have performed on the radio version of Gunsmoke , which aired from 1952 to 1961, but there is no evidence that he ever did. (A scientist with a German accent would have been a rather unlikely choice to voice a character in a Western radio drama.) Most likely the TV Guide inquiry was the result of someone's taking a humorous remark a little too seriously. When renowned physicist Stephen Hawking appeared in a 1993 episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation , actor Brent Spiner, who portrayed the android Data, reportedly quipped that Hawking's cameo was \"the most notable moment in television history since Albert Einstein guest-starred on Gunsmoke .\" Apparently at least one TV fan didn't notice how firmly Spiner's tongue was planted in his cheek.",
