  "Origins": "The above-referenced ironic tale of a global warming activist's freezing to death in Antarctica was presented on the FOX Nation web site as a straightforward news story on 29 March 2010. However, the original source for the story (which is linked from the FOX site) was a 2006 article from ecoEnquirer.com, a satirical site featuring spoof articles such as \"Court Orders Fisherman to Apologize to Eagle\" and \"Penguins 'Fed Up' with Media Attention.\" Additionally, the site's disclaimer notes that all the content on the ecoEnquirer site is satirical, not real news: All content on this site, being a mixture of parody, satire, and lame humor, is for entertainment purposes only. If any content is found to be offensive or objectionable in any way, please accept our apologies ... but we also suggest that you get a life.",
