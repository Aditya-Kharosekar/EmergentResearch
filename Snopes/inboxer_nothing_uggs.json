  "Origins": "In January 2013, a scam purporting to offer a pair of UGG boots to those who followed particular links spread via Facebook. Those who went in search of the promised freebies reached Facebook look-alike pages bearing embedded countdown counters that helpfully showed rapidly reducing numbers of Uggs to be had.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "There is no free footware to be had: UGG is not giving away pairs of boots. This scam is similar to other \"giveaway\" traps such as the March 2012 con purporting to offer free pairs of Toms Shoes . The web pages the hopeful are led to (which are not operated or sponsored by UGG) ask the unwary to repost the message in their profiles and click \"like\" buttons to claim the promised pair of boots. From there they are redirected to another page asking for their e-mail addresses, then led through a web of proffered deals (which according to their posted Terms and Conditions require those about to be duped and three friends complete a total of 11 \"reward offers\"). It needs to be kept in mind that personal data (name, date of birth, phone numbers, address) submitted via such forms will be shared with other marketers and/or scammers.",
