  "Origins": "On 21 April 2015, LinkedIn user Jean-Michel Letennier published an article to the social networking site titled \"U.S. Supreme Court Says No License Necessary to Drive Automobile on Public Highways/Streets.\" It was re-published (verbatim) to the site WeAreChange.org on 21 July 2015 and was subsequently picked up by a number of Facebook users, although versions of the text have circulated online since at least 2011 [PDF], and the claims it contains are likely far older. The article included nothing in the way of explaining why its subject was supposedly a current issue, and its core assertions are similar to rumors that one can sidestep legal entanglements simply through the application of little-known knowledge, such as avoiding income tax simply by invoking the \"fact\" that payment of such taxes is voluntary.",
  "Fact Check": "Has the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that no license is necessary to drive a car on public roads?",
  "Description": "Before launching into a potpourri of case excerpts from the Supreme Court (and lower courts), the missive provided an out-of-context quote (with some contextual clues as to its modern day relevance): \"The right of a citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, by horsedrawn carriage, wagon, or automobile, is not a mere privilege which may be permitted or prohibited at will, but a common right which he has under his right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Under this constitutional guaranty one may, therefore, under normal conditions, travel at his inclination along the public highways or in public places, and while conducting himself in an orderly and decent manner, neither interfering with nor disturbing another's rights, he will be protected, not only in his person, but in his safe conduct. [Thompson v. Smith, 154 SE 579, 11 American Jurisprudence, Constitutional Law, section 329, page 1135]\" A full citation for the referenced case, a 1930 decision titled \"Thompson v. Smith, 155 Va. 367 Va: Supreme Court 1930\" (available via Google Scholar) presents that inaugural quote in an entirely different context: The right of a citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon in the ordinary course of life and business is a common right which he has under his right to enjoy life and liberty, to acquire and possess property, and to pursue happiness and safety. It includes the right in so doing to use the ordinary and usual conveyances of the day; and under the existing modes of travel includes the right to drive a horse-drawn carriage or wagon thereon, or to operate an automobile thereon, for the usual and ordinary purposes of life and business. It is not a mere privilege, like the privilege of moving a house in the street, operating a business stand in the street, or transporting persons or property for hire along the street, which a city may permit or prohibit at will. The exercise of such a common right the city may, under its police power, regulate in the interest of the public safety and welfare; but it may not arbitrarily or unreasonably prohibit or restrict it, nor may it permit one to exercise it and refuse to permit another of like qualifications, under like conditions and circumstances, to exercise it. The regulation of the exercise of the right to drive a private automobile on the streets of the city may be accomplished in part by the city by granting, refusing, and revoking, under rules of general application, permits to drive an automobile on its streets; but such permits may not be arbitrarily refused or revoked, or permitted to be held by some and refused to other of like qualifications, under like circumstances and conditions. In other words, the use of public roads is a right which citizens enjoy, but local jurisdictions may regulate such use (including imposing a requirement that motor vehicle operators obtain licenses) so long as such regulation is reasonable, not arbitrary, and applies equally to everyone. Another bit of context elided in the circulating piece is the fact that in when this decision was handed down by the Supreme Court of Virginia in 1930, fewer than 40 of the 48 states required driver's licenses to operate a motor vehicle. Moreover, fewer than one in five Americans owned a car in the 1930s, a demographic that saw little upswing through the Depression and into World War II. As such, wider vehicle ownership and modern operator requirements were still decades in the future at the time of the ruling cited. No recent Supreme Court ruling has in any way challenged the legality of a requirement for driver's licenses. Driver's licenses are issued state by state (with varying requirements), not at the federal level or according to federal requirements. And driving without a license is indeed illegal in all 50 states. Last updated: 24 July 2015",
