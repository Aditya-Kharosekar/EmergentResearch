  "Origins": "This poorly worded e-mail claiming that singer Britney Spears had committed suicide by hanging herself with a bedsheet at the Promises rehabilitation center in Malibu, California, was spammed to Internet users beginning in October 2007. Britney Spears is not dead, by suicide or any other means, nor (at the time of this e-mail , at least) is she a resident of the Promises clinic. This e-mail appears to be a come-on intended to lure unsuspecting recipients into visiting and installing malware from a web site by purporting to offer a link to a video clip of Britney's \"last moments.\"",
