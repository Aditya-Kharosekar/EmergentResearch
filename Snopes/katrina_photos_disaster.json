  "Description": "The screen shot displayed above, presumably captured from a Sky News (Ireland) broadcast, uses a text caption in conjunction with a video clip of President Bush to convey that the President had declared Hurricane Katrina to be \"one of the worst disasters to hit the U.S.\" Without the video context however, the caption could be read as labeling President Bush \"one of the worst disasters ever to hit the U.S.,\"especially given the lack of quotation marks to offset the phrase and indicate it was a paraphrase of his words rather than the news agency's descriptor.",
