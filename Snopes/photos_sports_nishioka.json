  "Description": "On 12 August 2015, #134-ranked Japanese tennis player Yoshihito Nishioka squared off against #153-ranked Jared Donaldson in the second round of the Aptos Challenger tournament, a match Nishioka won in three sets. In the third set of that contest, Nishioka and Donaldson engaged in an intense, back-and-forth rally that the 19-year-old Nishioka looked to have lost as he was caught heading left on a ball hit to his right; but Nishioka instinctively flicked his racket behind his back in desperation and caught the ball perfectly, sending it down the sideline for a winner: \"Oh no ... I mean ... come on!\" reported the stunned announcer, as Nishioka dropped his racket and raised his hands in an \"Wow, look what I did!\" gesture. Although the Aptos Challenger is a little-known tournament, Nishioka's shot didn't escape the notice of the tennis world: In actual tennis playing news, Yoshihito Nishioka with arguably the shot of the year in all of tennis, on Donaldson. https://t.co/Q2mulfNQH2 Andrew Jerell Jones (@sluggahjells) August 13, 2015",
