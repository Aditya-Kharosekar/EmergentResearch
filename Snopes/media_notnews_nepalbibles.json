  "Origins": "On 28 April 2015, the web site The Lapine published a (since-deleted) article reporting that the Gideon Society had sent 100,000 paperback Bibles to Nepal (a country that is primarily Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim) as a form of earthquake relief:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing that report were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news item. However, the article was just a spoof that originated with The Lapine , a Canadian-based satirical web site whose \"About\" statement announced: The Lapine is Canada's Best Satirical Online Newspaper. It satirizes politics, life, media and the human condition, with a special focus on Canada. No Lapine content is intended to hurt even the most delicate of feelings ... but it's bound to happen. Get over it. But if you have concerns, let us know. Did we mention that The Lapine is satire? (Additional clues to the site's nature are that its name is taken from a language spoken by rabbit characters in the novel Watership Down , and that the site's motto is \"Rabbits eat Onions.\") Other fake news stories published by The Lapine include \"Atheist Suicide Bomber Kills Eighteen Agnostics,\" \"Dalai Lama Spotted Wearing 'Leave Justin Alone' Button,\" and \"Arizona Gun Buyers Offered Free Flag Tattoo.\"",
