  "Origins": "The quote reproduced above, attributed to British Petroleum (BP) representative Randy Prescott, was originally reported on 24 May 2010 by The Lens, a New Orleans-based news site: BP representative Hugh Depland said that while the company wasn't sure exactly when more workers would be hired, the $239 billion company was spending \"a lot of money, time and effort to bring this event to a close.\" And to those worried restaurateurs facing rising prices for shrimp and oysters? In the words of fellow BP rep Randy Prescott: \"Louisiana isn t the only place that has shrimp.\" The Lens later (skeptically) noted that although the quote was accurate as they reported it, Randy Prescott claimed a different interpretation of what he had meant in saying it:",
