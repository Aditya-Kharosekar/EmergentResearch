  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "While the above-quoted article has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter, there is no truth to the claim that Michelle Obama is proposing a national \"Hug A Musilm\" day. A disclaimer on the National Report states that all articles published on the website are completely fictional: National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.",
