  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The article pulled the wool over the eyes of several football fans on social media with its entirely fabricated claim. A disclaimer on the site from which the article originated explained: Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental. The tale of the Green Bay Packers' use of magnetic gloves is one of a number outrageous fake news stories published by Empire News . Prior hoaxes include a claim that a \"record-shattering snowfall \" will blanket most of the United States, a story about Colorado's legalizing crystal meth , and yarn about Congress giving all welfare recipients free cars with monthly gas stipends.",
