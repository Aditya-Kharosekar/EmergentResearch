  "Origins": "Austria is indeed home to a town called 'Fucking' (48 04'N 12 51'E), a name derived from that of 'Focko,' a 6th century Bavarian nobleman. And as noted in a Telegraph article about residents' considering a change in spelling for the town's name, the locals do have quite a problem dealing with stolen signs:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Here are a few photos of the hard-to-keep signs: The second sign carries the hilarity even further: \"Bitte nicht so schnell!\" is German for \"Please not so fast!\" (Evidently this type of sign is a commonplace reminder in those parts for motorists to keep their speed down to protect children, but many viewers find the unintended double meaning in this case particularly amusing.)",

  "Example": "[Collected on the Internet, 2000] Tourists are causing a lot of anxiety and are costing money to a tiny village where signs keep disappearing. What do the signs read? \"Welcome to Fucking, Austria.\" Pronounced \"fooking,\" the little hamlet of Fucking is named after the man who founded the village in the 6th century. His name? Focko. The town sign has been stolen seven times in the last few months. With signs costing several hundred dollars apiece, much of the tiny town s budget is being spent replacing the signs, says Siegfried Hoeppel, the Mayor of Fucking. He went on to express his hope that further thefts will be avoided through the use of increased concrete and ... bigger screws.",
