  "Origins": "On 29 September 2013, the web site The Lapine published an article positing that Senator Ted Cruz of Texas went into a shouting tirade after a Hooters restaurant refused to accept his government expense account credit card as payment for a $53 tab:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing that article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news item. However, the article was just a spoof that originated with The Lapine , a Canadian-based satirical web site. (Clues to the site's nature are that its name is taken from a language spoken by rabbit characters in the novel Watership Down , and that the site's motto is \"Rabbits eat Onions.\") Other stories published by The Lapine include \"Atheist Suicide Bomber Kills Eighteen Agnostics,\" \"Dalai Lama Spotted Wearing 'Leave Justin Alone' Button,\" and \"Arizona Gun Buyers Offered Free Flag Tattoo.\"",
