  "Origins": "Oneof the hazards a kayaker might least expect when plying ocean waters is for a killer whale to breach the surface and land on him, but that's what is depicted as happening to one of a group of three kayakers on the video clip displayed above. (The capsized kayaker resurfaces at the end of the clip and, apparently unharmed, rights his craft.)",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "However, this clip, which circulates under the French joke name of \"Regis fait du kayak,\" isn't the real thing: It's part of a Korean-language version of a commercial for Powerade energy drink (a product of the Coca-Cola Company). Powerade is noted for producing commercials using a variety of tricky visual effects to depict athletes accomplishing seemingly impossible feats of strength and skill (to the accompaniment of breathless narration by on-the-spot announcers), and this kayak commercial is yet another example of that genre. In this case, the commercial's producers took some footage available in the documentary Lolita: Slave to Entertainment (viewable in the film's trailer ) and added the kayaks through digital manipulation: Powerade commercial footage Original footage",
