  "Origins": "The video clip linked above does not capture an innocent beachgoer being snatched by a killer whale. As indicated by the graphic overlay, it's a television commercial created for the Dominican Republic-based chain of La Sirena retail stores. The wording of the caption, \"No todos los l pices dan suerte, s lo el l piz la suerte de La Sirena,\" roughly translates as \"Not all pencils give you luck, only the Lucky Pencil from La Sirena.\"",

Very graphic! He happened to be waving at a friend taking a film of him, and it was his last wave! If his friend hadn't been filming, or even looking in that direction there would have been no proof. He was just gone in less than a heartbeat. Too scary ...",
