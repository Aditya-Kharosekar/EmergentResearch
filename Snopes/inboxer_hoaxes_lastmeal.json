  "Origins": "This absurd item about a Texas \"cannibal pedophile\" death row inmate named Doug Stephener, who requested that his last meal before execution be a (non-Asian) child a request that the state is now obligated to satisfy by procuring a corpse for him appears to have originated as a hoax news item /petition on French-language web sites (hence the stiltedness of translated English-language versions).",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "If the sheer ridiculousness of this item's premise isn't sufficiently self-debunking, then we offer as negative proof the fact that according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice , no one named Doug Stephener (or Stephen K. Walker) has been, or is about to be, executed in the state of Texas. Moreover, the practice of allowing a condemned prisoner to choose his final meal is merely a courtesy that has traditionally been extended to those about to be executed for their crimes; no state mandates that all such requests must be fulfilled, no matter how unusual, impractical, or costly they might be. In fact, the state of Texas ended the provision of last meal requests to inmates back in 2011 when a condemned man ridiculously asked for \"two chicken fried steaks, a triple-meat bacon cheeseburger, fried okra, a pound of barbecue, three fajitas, a meat lover's pizza, a pint of ice cream and a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts,\" then didn't eat any of that bounty.",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, September 2014] A Man asks for a child as his last meal. Doug Stephener a cannibal pedophile sentenced to death in Texas asked this weekend as his last meal ... a little boy. Man, that will be executed by lethal injection next week filing his application stating that he wanted to enjoy a maximum of 8 years old child. He also said he refused the child to be of Asian origin. The Department of Corrections is supposed to have to accept all the demands of any kind. So it may be that they are buying a corpse in a morgue to satisfy the desires of Doug Stephener. Doug Stephener was sentenced to death in 2008 for rape and cannibalism of children in his neighborhood. ABILENE, TX Stephen K. Walker, French M. Robertson Unit inmate inAbilene, Texas, is on death row for murder and cannibalism of the 2006case that sentenced him to death. When asked what he would want his final meal to be, he said with nohesitation, \"A little boy.\" The Department of Corrections are supposed to accept all the demands ofany kind. So it was initially thought that they were buying a corpse in amorgue to satisfy the desires of Stephen Walker. But tables turned when it was said that they were trying to find a toddlerfrom a third world country and buy him/her alive within a budget of$25,000. State representative Michael Rath talked to the media briefly with wordsthat he thought would clear the situation some: \"We live in a country where we have laws in place and morals, and we willlook to grant Mr. Walker his request under certain circumstances that wehave yet to agree to.\" He stated. As far as the 'circumstances,' it is rumored that the child would have tosuffer from some type of degenerative disease, with a few years to live.And by honoring Walkers request it saves the child from years ofsuffering. We will see how this plays out. Walker will be executed next Saturday.\"",
