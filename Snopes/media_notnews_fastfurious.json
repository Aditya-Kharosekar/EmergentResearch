  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Soon afterwards many social media users and web sites were sharing this article, believing it to be genuine news especially given that it came on the heels of a similar rumor started the previous month by HollywoodLife , who made a spoof video envisioning how Bieber would be taking over for Walker to complete Fast & Furious 7 (production of which had been interrupted by the latter's untimely death): However, there is no truth to any of this: The source of the article quoted above, National Report , is a fake news web site (prominently featured in our article \" 5 Fake News Sites to Avoid Sharing \"). The National Report 's disclaimer page notes: National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.",
