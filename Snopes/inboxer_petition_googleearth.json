  "Origins": "This appeal to vote for whether Google Earth should identify Israel or Palestine on its maps of the Middle East hit the Internet in mid-2014 amidst armed conflict between Israeli forces and Hamas militants. There was nothing to it: Google doesn't choose how to identify the national entities shown on its maps by popular vote, and Google Earth recognizes both Israel and Palestine as geopolitical entities to users who search on either of those terms. The only purpose this putative \"vote\" serves is to drive traffic to the named (non-Google affiliated) site.",
