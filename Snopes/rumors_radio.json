  "Origins": "It's not unusual in a time of sadness and mourning such as the one following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. that radio and television stations temporarily suspend the airing of material programs, songs, advertisements that might be considered insensitive or in bad taste. Just as an airline wouldn't show in-flight films featuring airplane crashes, especially after a particularly horrible airliner accident, so entertainment outlets generally opt to temporarily dispense with material dealing with death and disaster in the wake of terrible real-life events. So, many radio stations have recently invoked voluntary moratoriums on songs which refer to airplanes, crashes, violence, and death in their lyrics or titles.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Accordingly, a program director at Clear Channel Communications (an organization which operates over 1,170 radio stations in the United States), after discussions with program directors at several of Clear Channel Radio's stations, compiled an advisory list of songs which stations might wish to avoid playing in the short term: After and during what was happening in New York and Washington and outside of Pittsburgh, some of our program directors began e-mailing each other about songs and questionable song titles Given the environment, a Clear Channel program director took it upon himself to identify a number of songs that certain markets or individuals may find insensitive today. This was not a mandate, nor was the list generated out of the corporate radio offices. It was a grassroots effort that was apparently circulated among program directors. Note that The New York Times posits a smaller, earlier version of the list did originate in Clear Channel's corporate offices: Others in the Clear Channel network . . . said that a smaller list of questionable songs was originally generated by the corporate office, but an overzealous regional executive began contributing suggestions and circulating the list via e-mail, where it continued to grow. Other than some rather questionable choices of songs, the only thing remarkable about this list is that so many sensation-hungry news outlets have attempted to spin it as an outrageous mandate by Clear Channel to \"ban\" certain songs from the airwaves. Clear Channel did not issue the list to their stations as a directive mandating that the listed songs not be played, as Robert Hilburn noted in the Los Angeles Times : The Clear Channel list is apparently not a flat prohibition against these songs by the nation's largest chain of radio stations. They are simply recordings whose appropriateness has been questioned by individual program directors. Radio personnel were still free to make their own programming decisions, and the list was merely intended as helpful advisory information. For example, a program director scanning a list of song titles might not immediately recall that the lyrics to James Taylor's \" Fire and Rain \" are widely perceived as referring to a plane crash which supposedly claimed the life of his girlfriend (they don't), but the title's appearance on the list might help call that to mind. Clearly (no pun intended), Clear Channel's stations were still making their own choices about what music to program, as The New York Times reported: The move by Clear Channel, whose collective broadcasts reach more than 110 million listeners in the nation weekly, was voluntary. Many stations, including some in the New York area, said they were disregarding the list, which was distributed internally . . . . . . compliance with the list varied from station to station. Angela Perelli, the vice president for operations at KYSR (98.7 FM) in Los Angeles, said the station was not playing any of the listed songs and had previously pulled a couple of the cited songs, \"Jumper\" by Third Eye Blind and \"Fly\" by Sugar Ray, on its own accord. On the other hand, Bob Buchmann, the program director and an on-air personality at WAXQ-FM (104.3) in Manhattan, said that some songs on the list (\"American Pie\" by Don McLean, \"Imagine\" and others) happened to be among the most-played songs on his station. In the meantime, the station decided not to broadcast some songs even though they did not make the list, such as \"When You're Falling,\" a collaboration between Peter Gabriel and Afro-Celt Sound System that had fictional lyrics too eerily similar to the truth. (Despite Slate 's spin on the issue, Clear Channel did not deny that such a list existed. They maintained, correctly, that \"Clear Channel Radio has not banned any songs from any of its radio stations.\") Although some of the entries on this list might make it appear a humorous parody at first glance, many stations are indeed forgoing even songs such as \"What a Wonderful World\" under the philosophy that upbeat music is inappropriate at this time: Top 40 Z104 (WWZZ), owned by Bonneville, was pulling certain songs from the air because of their titles, such as Dave Matthews's \"Crash Into Me.\" But General Manager Mark O'Brien said most songs that were yanked from the air were done so because of their \"happy-go-lucky, life is great\" tone. \"Anything up-tempo is still off the air today,\" he said yesterday. Giving a pass to songs such as \"Ticket to Ride\" or \"I Go to Pieces\" or \"Ruby Tuesday\" simply because of their titles might be a bit extreme, but there's no telling what an audience might find upsetting in the current climate, as the Washington Post reported: Despite the efforts, some songs deemed inappropriate slipped through the cracks. The reaction was swift in at least one case, suggesting that people's sensitivities are on high alert. Over the weekend, WASH played Kool & the Gang's \"Celebration,\" which brought a polite if reproachful call from one listener, who was assured by the station the song's broadcast was a mistake.",
