  "Origins": "On 28 September 2013, the National Report published an article positing that a new form of sexually transmitted disease (STD) had been discovered among residents of the city of Portland, Oregon:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "By the following day links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, the article was just a bit of satire from the National Report , a web site that publishes outrageous fictional stories such as \"IRS Plans to Target Leprechauns Next,\" \"Boy Scouts Announce Boobs Merit Badge,\" and \"New CDC Study Indicates Pets of Gay Couples Worse at Sports, Better at Fashion Than Pets of Straight Couples.\" The National Report 's (since removed) disclaimer page notes that: National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, September 2013] There are stories going around about a new std that comes from Portland OR, & that 1/4 of the entire city's population has it. Says it is an untreatable mutation \"Super Aids\" - sounds unbelievable to me.",
