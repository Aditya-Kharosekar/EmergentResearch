  "Origins": "In December 2013, Facebook users began seeing posts purportedly issued by media outlets teasing the story that rapper Lil Wayne (who is an epileptic) had died after a seizure, featuring headlines such as \"RIP Lil Wayne, Rapper Found Dead\" and offering links to a video report on the subject. No such tragic fate has befallen the popular singer, however. Not only are the accounts of his death a hoax, but those reports are being spread by a malicious Facebook app. When users are tricked into clicking through on these fake \"R.I.P Lil Wayne\" posts to see the promised news videos, they end up installing a rogue app that posts the same very thing to other Facebook pages in their name.",
