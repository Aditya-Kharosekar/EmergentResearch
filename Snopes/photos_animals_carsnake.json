  "Origins": "Snakes, being cold-blooded creatures, seek out warm places to rest, and the engine block of a car (especially one which is still radiating heat from recent use) fits the bill sometimes to the detriment of the snake, as in this case.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Although the type of snake shown in these pictures, a ball python, is not typically found in North America, these photographs genuinely depict the surprise a St. Louis man found under the hood of his Acura automobile. (The serpent may have been an escaped pet, or a captive snake deliberately placed under the hood by someone as a prank.) We heard from both the car's owner and a representative from the service department at Frank Leta Acura , both of whom confirmed that the pictures displayed above were real, that the automobile did come into the shop as pictured, and that the only damage suffered by the car was to the belt. (The snake itself, obviously, did not survive the ordeal.)",
