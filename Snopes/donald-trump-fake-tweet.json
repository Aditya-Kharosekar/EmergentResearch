  "Example": "[Collected via Email, December 2015] Did Donald Trump say the following? \"My grandparents didn't come all the way to America from Germany just to see it taken over by immigrants. Not on my watch.\" Origin:In December 2015, Facebook users began sharing a quote, purportedly from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, about his immigrant grandparents and his anti-immigration stance: While it's true that Trump's grandfather Frederick Trump emigrated from Germany to the United States, and that Trump the candidate has made immigration reform a central plank of his platform the above-displayed quote was not uttered by Donald Trump. The quote first appeared on the twitter account @McDonaldJTrump on 6 September 2015: This tweet issued from a Donald Trump parody account and not Trump's real Twitter account, as is clearly stated in the bio associated with the former: I will make America great again because I myself am great. The J in my name does NOT stand for Joke. Also I have really great hair. I'm not Donald J. Trump. Last updated: 22 December 2015 Originally published: 22 December 2015",
