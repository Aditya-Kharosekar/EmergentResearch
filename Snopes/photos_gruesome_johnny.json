  "Origins": "The \"Rubber Johnny\" video which can be found on various sites around the Internet is an abstract short film created by Chris Cunningham.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The film itself is difficult to describe in ordinary terms, but it is commonly summarized as follows: Rubber Johnny documents a 16-year-old, inbred mutant's solitary existence, locked in a pitch-black basement by his ashamed parents. They are TV addict rednecks who occasionally feed Johnny and yell at him for making noise. Johnny's only company in the basement is his little dog. His dog's I.Q. far outstrips Johnny's, who is a completely insane, bi-polar imbecile. Featuring music by Aphex Twin",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, 2005] Saw this and was just wondering what exactly it is. I'm tempted to think the entire thing is a hoax, maybe some home-movie-horror film. It sounds like sound effects were added towards the end.",
