  "Origins": "This message purportedly issued by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims that beginning on 20 March 2014 Facebook will be launching a \"No Religion\" campaign prohibiting the \"spreading [of] religious beliefs\" on that social network, with those who violate the new policy having their accounts deleted all at the behest of advertisers and groups seeking a \"more logical\" and \"adult\" social network.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The message is just a hoax, yet another entry in a series of similar japes proclaiming that Facebook is launching a \" no swearing \" campaign or a \" no marijuana \" campaign. Facebook has made no announcement about banning the spreading of material related to religion and religious beliefs, and the bottom line is that Facebook doesn't issue important announcements about any policy change through the medium of having their CEO post images on the Internet with poorly-checked spelling, punctuation, and grammar: they notify users via e-mail, and they post information about their policy changes in the appropriate administrative section of Facebook.com.",
