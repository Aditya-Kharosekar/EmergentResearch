  "Origins": "One might think of the image displayed above, which apparently captures a Ku Klux Klan member (presumably the victim of a trauma) being treated by an all-black emergency room staff, as the flipside of familiar accounts of blacks dying from treatable injuries during the Jim Crow era of segregation because they were refused treatment at \"whites-only\" hospitals. In this photo, however, the black ER staff doesn't turn the tables by refusing to treat a KKK member despite his membership in an organization dedicated to terrorizing them; instead, they diligently work at saving his life, the same as they would for any other patient.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Despite many viewers' mistaking it for such, this photo is not a screen capture taken from an episode of the popular television hospital drama ER, nor is the doctor shown in the center of the picture actor Eriq LaSalle, who portrayed surgeon Dr. Peter Benton in that series. The crease down the middle of the image gives it away as a picture scanned from a printed source, and indeed it was this photo was a staged one created for a series of advertisements in Large magazine's \"For people who think bigger than they are\" ad campaign, which featured depictions of people acting nobly in the face of adverse circumstances:",
