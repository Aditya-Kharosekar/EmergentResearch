  "Origins": "Club 33, open only to members and their guests, has been a part of New Orleans Square since 1967. Originally intended as a private facility where Walt Disney could entertain park sponsors and lessees, Club 33 did not open until several months after Disney's death. The club's facilities were made available to the public through limited memberships, and Club 33 has operated unobtrusively in Disneyland's New Orleans Square ever since.",
