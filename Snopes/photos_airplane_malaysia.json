  "Origins": "The images displayed above have been circulated via Facebook and other social media sites with captions identifying them as pictures of \"crashed\" Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which disappeared over the South China Sea on 8 March 2014 with 239 persons (227 passengers and 12 crew members) aboard.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "In fact, the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER from Flight MH370 has not yet been located, and no determination has yet been made whether the aircraft crashed (either at sea or on land) or managed to land somewhere. The first photograph shown here is one that was submitted to the New York Times on 15 January 2009 and captures a US Airways jet that made an emergency landing in the Hudson River. The second shows a Lion Air Boeing 737 airliner that careered off a runway and crashed into the sea in Bali in April 2013",
