  "Origins": "We generally expect texts produced by legislatures and courts and other governmental agencies to be stodgy, prolix, and incomprehensible, so finding one one that is short and simple and even a bit whimsical is a welcome source of amusement. We recently came across an example of such in a bill submitted to the Minnesota legislature (H.F. 224) in January 2007 for the purpose of establishing the position of a state poet laureate. The main text of the bill is a mere twenty-four lines, written entirely in rhyming verse:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Alas, the Minnesota Daily noted that if the bill should pass, \"the poem would probably be taken out of the law and go on the books in standard legalese.\"",
