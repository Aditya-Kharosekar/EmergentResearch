  "Origins": "This photograph of a large snake first hit our inbox in May 2011, when it was most commonly described as a picture of a creature that was loosed in Louisiana when the Morganza Spillway was opened to relieve flooding pressures along the Mississippi River. It has also been circulated with text identifying it as a King Brown snake photographed in New South Wales (NSW), Australia; a black mamba from South Africa; and a snake (of unidentified species) spotted in \"Delray [Beach], near Tamarac, Florida.\"",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The identification of the Australian locale appears to be correct, but not the snake's status as a genuine example of reptilian wildlife. According to a discussion thread on reddit , the snake is a sculpture situated alongside Uralba Street in Alstonville, NSW, where one of the site's member photographed herself with the artwork in January 2012:",
