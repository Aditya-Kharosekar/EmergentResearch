  "Origins": "On 8 April 2015, the News Examiner web site published an article reporting that President Obama had limited churches to offering twice-monthly services in order to ensure Americans worked harder:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "President Obama could not have made any such announcement, as he has no authority to limit church services, and any attempt to do so would be an obvious violation of the First Amendment's protections of religious freedom. The referenced article was a just another hoax from the News Examiner, a fake news site started by Paul Horner, the former lead writer for the similarly fake National Report web site, after Facebook implemented a crackdown on the posting of hoax articles that virtually destroyed the latter site's reach. Previous hoaxes from the same site include the false claim that the world's first head transplant was successfully performed in South Africa in April 2015. The \"hotline\" phone number provided in the article is actually that of the infamous Westboro Baptist Church.",
