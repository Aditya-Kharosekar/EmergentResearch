  "Origins": "In June 2010, Los Angeles County \"became the latest government body to boycott Arizona to protest the state's tough new law targeting illegal immigration\":",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The image displayed above supposedly shows a billboard erected in Phoenix in response to Los Angeles' boycott of Arizona, a sign which sardonically informs illegal immigrants that \"Los Angeles loves you\" and suggests they head west on Interstate 8 out of Arizona and into California. However, this image is a digitally created mock-up and not a genuine photograph of a real billboard. Elements such as the saguaro cactus on the left-hand side of the picture and the Arizona state flag, for example, were clearly pasted in from other cactus and flag photos: Probably not coincidentally, immediately before this billboard image began circulating, a letter to the editor from a Phoenix resident was published in the Arizona Republic advocating the very idea depicted above: Arizona citizens should erect a billboard on northbound Interstate 10 just south of Casa Grande that says in Spanish: \"Attention, illegal immigrants. Arizona does not welcome you. But Los Angeles loves you. Free housing. Free school. Free food. Free medical and hospital. No insurance costs nor taxes. Plentiful jobs. Turn left on 8 and follow your road to paradise.\" - John Forster, Phoenix",
