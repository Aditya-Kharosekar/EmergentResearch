  "Origins": "In June 2007 the Boston Globe reported that in 1983, current Republican presidential hopeful (and former Massachusetts governor) Mitt Romney had placed his Irish setter in a dog carrier on the roof of his station wagon for a 12-hour trip to his parents' cottage on the Canadian shores of Lake Huron. He'd built a windshield for the carrier to make the ride more comfortable for the dog. He'd also made it clear to his five sons that bathroom breaks would be taken only during predetermined stops to gas up the car.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The dog spoiled this plan by letting loose with a bout of diarrhea during its rooftop sojourn, necessitating an unplanned gas station visit for the purpose of hosing down the pooch, its carrier, and the back of the car. In that Boston Globe article, the incident was pointed to as an example of Romney's emotion-free crisis management style. Others viewed it differently, regarding the mode of canine transport the dog was subjected to as unnecessarily callous and cruel. Romney dismisses such critics by saying \"They're not happy that my dog loves fresh air.\"",
