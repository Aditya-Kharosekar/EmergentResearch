  "Description": "The photograph displayed above wasn't taken in Georgia and wasn't taken in 2012, nor does it depict a tornado. It's one of a series of May 2008 photographs of the Chaiten Volcano in southern Chile erupting during a nighttime storm: Few sights in nature can compare to the sheer magnificence of a volcano erupting in full flow. But while scenes of molten lava are relatively commonplace, this otherworldly picture of Chaiten Volcano in southern Chile shows a truly spectacular, and devastating, volcanic phenomenon. This astonishing picture shows the Chaiten volcano erupting during storms in the middle of the night As clouds of toxic ash and dust tower into the sky, they ionise the air, generating an explosive electrical storm. Colossal forks of lightning spark around the noxious plume as it spews from the volcano's crater, creating an image of raw, terrifying energy as if the air itself were ablaze.",
