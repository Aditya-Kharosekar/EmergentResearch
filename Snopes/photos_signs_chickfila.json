  "Origins": "In the midst of a July 2012 controversy over interview remarks regarding same-sex marriage made by Dan Cathy, president and chief operating officer of the Chick-fil-A fast food restaurant chain, came suggestions from some city officials that Chick-fil-A outlets would not be welcome in their towns and calls for a boycott of the company's products. During that time the image shown above began circulating, purportedly showing a sign at McDonald's restaurant stating the hamburger behemoth supports Chick-fil-A and defiantly urging viewers to \"Now try to boycott us.\"",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The image doesn't show a real sign outside any McDonald's restaurant or business office, however. It's merely a digital fabrication created through the use of the online Fast Food Sign Generator app. The following two similar graphics employing KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) signs were also created using the Fast Food Sign Generator app: Although the images displayed above were all fabricated, some Wendy's outlets in North and South Carolina did display the message \"WE STAND WITH CHICK-FIL-A\" on their signs.",
