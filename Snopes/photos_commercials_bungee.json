  "Origins": "The above-linked video clip purportedly shows, to the accompaniment of an Australian-accented announcer, a bungee jump over a river by one \"Big Doug\" which ends in tragedy when Big Doug's head is bitten off by a crocodile who emerges from the depths with jaws open wide just as Doug hits the water headfirst.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "One tell-tale clue to this video clip's authenticity is the fact the audio cuts out halfway through. The reason for this is editing is that a voice-over at the conclusion of the original, unedited clip reveals it to be a television commercial for Foster's Beer : \"New Foster's hit tap. Don't lose your head.\" This 2003 Foster's commercial, promoting \"a new pouring system intended to give drinkers a consistent head on their pint,\" drew complaints when it first aired from hundreds of viewers who were disturbed by the seeming authenticity of the home video-style ad.",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, 2005] I received this video clip on 10/24/2005, from a friend. There is no mention of time/place/or circumstances regarding this video. I hope you can determine if it is real or fake. From the accent on the video, it has to be Australia. However, the \"Croc\" seems all too coincidental! [Note: This video clip is a large file please be patient while it downloads.]",
