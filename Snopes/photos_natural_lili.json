  "Origins": "Our job is made so much easier when people manipulate photos available on the Internet, because sooner or later someone turns up the original(s).",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The picture shown above is purportedly a spectacular photograph of a \"triple tornado\" accompanying Hurricane Lili , which made landfall in Louisiana in early October 2002, becoming the first hurricane to touch the US since Hurricane Irene in 1999. (Not to be confused with a previous Hurricane Lili , which hit Cuba in mid-October 1996.) However, the same photo appeared on page 6 of the Fall 2001 issue of Anchor Lines (a newsletter for Edison Chouest Offshore and affiliated maritime companies operating in the Louisiana Gulf): That photograph, of a single waterspout, was taken in the Gulf of Mexico back in June 2001 by a crewmember of the C-Rambler, a 240-foot supply boat. Someone manipulated the original and turned it into a photograph of three waterspouts, a picture that began circulating as an amazing image of a triple tornado associated with the storms of Hurricane Lili in October 2002.",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, 2002] This is a picture taken this morning (10/02/02) in the Gulf of Mexico of three tornadoes associated with the storms in the front storm bands of Hurricane Lili as she approaches the Louisiana coastline. The picture wastaken by a Seacor hand.",
