  "Origins": "On 28 November 2014, Empire News published an article reporting that President Obama's 16-year-old daughter Malia was pregnant:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "In what promises to be the biggest White House scandal since intern fellatio, President Barack Obama's daughter, 16-year-old Malia, has confirmed that she is pregnant. For now, Malia is staying hush-hush about the father's identity, but one thing she would say is that he is white. \"My mom always hoped I would get with a nice mixed-race man like dad, but love is so colorblind. Mom was probably right though. The dad already left me for some tramp. And of course, like all white men, my baby daddy won't want to pay his child support. I already told him, 'You want to keep your license so you can drive that bleach-blond tramp around in your little Jaguar, right? Better step up.'\" The article was written to appear as if it were a genuine news article, but there is no truth to the above-referenced story. Empire News is an \"entertainment\" (i.e., fake news) web site that doesn't publish factual articles. The site's previous hoax news articles include such items as \"Obama to Sign Executive Order Changing U.S. Currency From Dollar to Euro ,\" \"Best Buy CEO Says Black Friday Sales Went Well, 'Only 47 Deaths This Year,'\" and \"Woman Gives Birth During Black Friday Sale; Leaves Baby, Buys Big Screen TV.\"",
