  "Origins": "In August 2015, an image purportedly showing baseball player Adam LaRoche in a hospital after being attacked by a mountain lion started recirculating on Facebook. The image was originally created in response to a photograph of LaRoche with a dead mountain lion over his shoulders:",
  "Fact Check": "Was baseball player Adam LaRoche attacked by a mountain lion?",
  "Description": "While it's true that LaRoche killed a mountain lion during a bow hunt in 2014, the lioness did not \"get revenge\" on the baseball player. It's true that the photograph at the top of this article shows a victim of a mountain lion attack, but the man pictured is not baseball player Adam LaRoche. The image actually shows Jim Hamm, a hiker who was attacked by a mountain lion at Prairie Creek Redwords State Park in California in January 2007. Last updated: 10 August 2015",
