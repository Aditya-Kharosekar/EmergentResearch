  "Origins": "The image shown above may qualify as a genuine artwork, but not of the type claimed (i.e., a bathroom with its floor painted to make it appear open to the sky from thousands of feet in the air). It's another entry from a Worth1000.com contest , this one asking participants to creatively manipulate a photograph of an ordinary bathroom. The \"falling man\" entry has proved to be an especially popular one, and the image has been forwarded around the Internet with its contextual information removed and misleading comments added by some of its forwarders.",

  "Example": "[Collected via e-mail, 2005] I got this from a friend, apparently this is painted onto someone's bathroom floor! Have you seen this? It looks kind of fake to me... I just received a photo of a painted bathroom floor depicting a man being flushed down the toilet. Is it just one of those \"painted sidewalk\" type photos and if so is it an actual painting? IMAGINE . . . you are at a party. You have to go to the bathroom. There's only one at the house you're in. This is the bathroom you enter.",
