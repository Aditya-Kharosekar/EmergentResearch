  "Description": "By the following day links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, that article was just a bit of political humor which satirized O'Reilly's long-running battle against secular progressives whom he asserts have been waging a War on Christmas\" (including attempts to eliminate the use of the phrase \"Merry Christmas\" in favor of the more generic \"Happy Holidays\").
