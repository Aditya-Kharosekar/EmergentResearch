  "Origins": "The above-displayed video of a bank's drive-through canopy being destroyed by a truck pulling a travel trailer corresponds to security camera footage of an accident that took place on 2 July 2008 at the Texas State Bank in Center, Texas. Shelby County Today posted photographs of the accident along with the following description: At approximately 3 PM, Tuesday, July 2, a 2008 Dodge Ram 2500 pulling a new travel trailer, hit the corner of the Texas State Bank Drive-In on Tenaha Street, causing the complete awning to come to the ground. Luckily, the driver of the Dodge, Mickey Miller of Garrison, and his 10-year-old son were able to exit their vehicle uninjured. According to Miller he was circling the bank to park on the other side when the corner of his travel trailer caught the corner of the bank awning. Next thing he heard was a rumble as the awning started falling against his driver's side door. Somehow he was able to unbuckle the seat beat and exit the other side of his truck as it was falling. Mark Ivy of Texas State Bank stated that the main lobby would be open for business while the drive-in is being repaired.",
