  "Origins": "On 27 October 2014 the National Report published an article claiming the United States Government was raising the minimum hunting age to twenty-one :",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The National Report article was presented like an authentic news story: It used a fabricated quote from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman Gregory Pearson (who is not a real person) and cited a petition from the NRA (which does not exist). But since the writing resembled a professional news piece, many readers believed that it was true, and within a few days of its publication thousands of people had shared it on Facebook. The National Report has had a lot of practice publishing fake news stories. The website's disclaimer page (which has since been removed) states that the National Report is a \"political satire web publication.\" The minimum hunting age in the United States is currently decided by individual states. In Idaho, for instance, children between the ages of 10 and 17 may get a hunting licence after they pass a hunter education course. Alaska does not require a license if the hunter is under the age of 15.",
