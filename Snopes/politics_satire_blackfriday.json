  "Origins": "On 26 November 2012, the day after Thanksgiving weekend in the U.S., the Onion published an article positing that 42 million people had been killed over that holiday in violent incidents stemming from shoppers competing for \"Black Friday\" bargains:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "By the following day links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, that article was just a bit of fictional humor spoofing \"Black Friday\" commercial madness from the satirical Onion publication, whose FAQ notes that: The Onion is a satirical weekly publication published 52 times a year on Thursdays. The Onion uses invented names in all its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.",
