  "Origins": "On 20 November 2014, the Daily Currant published an article titled \"Sarah Palin: Send Immigrants 'Back Across Ocean' to Mexico.\" Referencing President Barack Obama's announcement about immigration reform on 19 November 2014, the article claimed Palin appeared on Fox News after Obama's speech to discuss the issue:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "As with a previous preposterous claim Sarah Palin demanded President Obama \" invade Ebola ,\" the article was a satirical piece poking fun at the former governor of Alaska. Palin was not even a guest on the Fox News Hannity program on 19 November 2014. The Daily Currant is a satire site known for publishing fake news stories, including a previous article claiming grits were a leading factor in fathering homosexual children. According to the site's \"About\" page: Our stories are purely fictional. However they are meant to address real-world issues through satire and often refer and link to real events happening in the world.",
