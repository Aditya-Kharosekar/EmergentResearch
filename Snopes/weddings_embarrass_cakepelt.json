  "Origins": "The 17 March 2001 wedding of Kathryn Marie to Brett Patrick seemed to go off all right, but the wedding night was less than a screaming success (unless you're a fight fan, that is).",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "A late-night disagreement over wedding gifts erupted into fisticuffs back at the couple's home. The bride threw wedding cake at her new husband, punched him in the face, then kicked and beat him while he was on the ground. Officers said Mr. Patrick had bruises and scratches and telltale icing on his body as evidence of the abuse. Kathryn Marie Patrick was arrested and charged with domestic battery on 18 March 2001. She was released on $5,000 bail that day. She reported that she was 10 weeks pregnant at the time. The Patricks aren't the first battling newlyweds to grace our pages. In 1993, one just-wed couple got into it over the custom of feeding wedding cake to each other. Barbara \"the honeymooners\" Mikkelson",
