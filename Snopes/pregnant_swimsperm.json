  "Origins": "Another one of those silly, impossible stories nearly everyone heard as a child, a companion piece to the persistent adolescent legend that a girl cannot become pregnant through having sex in a chlorinated swimming pool and the tale of a woman's becoming pregnant from bathing in water into which a man has ejaculated.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "In July 2009 a suit was brought against an Egyptian hotel by a woman claiming her 13-year-old daughter got pregnant from using its swimming pool.",

  "Example": "[Collected on the Internet, 1993] I vaguely remember a legal case from 20-30 years ago in which a young girl sued and won judgement from a municipal swimming pool when she became pregnant. An intact virgin, she was being harrassed by a group of boys who ejaculated in the pool. (Nice kids). The pool was sued for not protecting the girl from the boys and because the pool was not sufficiently chlorinated. I make no arguments for this, just reporting what I read many many years ago. (For those claiming this to be some kind of urban legend, I do remember reading it.)",
