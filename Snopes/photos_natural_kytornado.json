  "Origins": "The photograph shown above is another recirculated weather phenomenon image, one which at least identifies the type of storm correctly (if not the date and location). This picture captured a tornado, but not one which hit any part of Kentucky in March 2012. Instead, the tornado (an F5) struck Elie, Manitoba , on 22 June 2007, and at the time was estimated to be the strongest tornado in Canadian history:",
