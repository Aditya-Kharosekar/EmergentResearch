The above-displayed photograph, however, is a fake that has been digitally altered. The real image, taken near Exit Glacier in Alaska, was posted to the White House Instagram account on 2 September 2015 and showed President Obama posing next to a sign indicating where the boundary of the now much-receded glacier was in 1961 (coincidentally also the year of President Obama's birth):",
