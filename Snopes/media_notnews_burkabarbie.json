  "Origins": "On 1 March 2015, the disreputable click-baiting web site American News regurgitated (and twisted) a news story from 2009 about a \"burka Barbie\" doll:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "In addition to misleading its readers about when the \"burka Barbie\" was created, American News included several other bits of misinformation. Primarily, Mattel did not create a \"Burka Barbie\" for the toy's 50th anniversary in 2009: the doll, which was an independent creation by Italian designer Eliana Lorena, was one of 500 dolls that was put up for auction that year as part of a benefit for the Save the Children Foundation: View image gettyimages.com Although Mattel supported the charity auction, the company did not \"launch\" the Burka Barbie to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Only a single doll of this description was produced (by someone else) for a charity auction; Mattel neither made nor sold the custom novelty doll created by Eliana Lorena.",
