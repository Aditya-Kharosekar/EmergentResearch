  "Origins": "On 28 May 2014, the World News Daily Report web site published an article positing that Kenyan authorities had released papers seemingly confirming U.S. President Barack Obama had been born in that country:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "That article largely remained dormant for five months after its initial publication, until 24 October 2014, when it was summarized on the disreputable, click-baiting American News web site under the title \"Kenyan Government Releases Obama's Real Birth Certificate.\" Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing the claims made in the original article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered it mistaking it for a genuine news item. However, the original article was just another spoof from World News Daily Report , a fake news web site whose stock in trade is publishing fantastically fictional stories. World News Daily Report 's disclaimer page states that: World News Daily Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within worldnewsdailyreport.com are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental, except for all references to politicians and/or celebrities, in which case they are based on real people, but still based almost entirely in fiction.",
