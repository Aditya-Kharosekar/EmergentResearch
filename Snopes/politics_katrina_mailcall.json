  "Origins": "The unofficial letter carrier's motto may be \"Neither rain, nor sleet nor snow nor dark of night shall stay this courier from his appointed rounds,\" but that credo doesn't encompass hurricanes and floods. The United States Postal Service (USPS) has to deal with the same logistical difficulties as everyone else, and so they've had to temporarily suspend mail delivery (or certain classes of mail delivery) to storm-stricken areas along the Gulf Coast. Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi are the states primarily affected; all USPS operations in Florida have now been restored.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "A full listing (by ZIP code) of the areas where mail delivery has been suspended can be found in the National Mail Service Updates section of the USPS web site. The USPS has also established temporary locations for the distribution of Social Security checks to victims in storm-stricken areas.",
