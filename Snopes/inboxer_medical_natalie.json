  "Origins": "This plea on behalf of a baby girl named Natalie who is supposedly suffering from brain cancer, purportedly penned by her distraught mother, Krista Marie, began making the Internet rounds in June 2002. This message is yet another variant of the same basic hoax , one which falsely claims that the American Cancer Society, AOL, or some other business or medical organization will donate a set amount of money every time a particular e-mail is forwarded.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The child mentioned in the e-mail is an invented one. Although many of the \"Natalie\" pleas arrive accompanied by the photo appearing on this page, the snapshot is not of the fictional Natalie but rather of Megan Olivia Cronce, who was born in September of 1996. Her proud parents placed her photo on the Internet, where it apparently was harvested by whoever was inspired to dress up this hoax with a graphic of the non-existent Natalie. Megan's photo appeared on a page hosted by Babypics.com . Barbara \"no natalieway\" Mikkelson",
