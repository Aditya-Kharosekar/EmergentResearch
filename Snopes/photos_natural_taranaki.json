  "Description": "However, those sources quickly withdrew their use of the photo after discovering that it was a fabrication created by a local resident: A New Plymouth woman has admitted creating the image of a tornado hitting New Plymouth, used on both TV One and TV3 news. She said it was meant to be an in-house joke at her place of work. She created the image as a \"bit of fun\" and was surprised the news organisations did not check its authenticity. \"It took two minutes to make and was so fudged it wasn't funny,\" the woman told the website",
