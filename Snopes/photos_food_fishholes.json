  "Origins": "One type of item commonly found in novelty stores and souvenir shops is ordinary food products vended in packaging that describes them as being some form of decidedly unappetizing (if not outright disgusting) animal-derived product. Thus bags of chocolate-covered nuts are sold as \" moose droppings ,\" tinned green beans are sold as \" porcupine peckers ,\" and cans of condensed milk are sold as \" jackalope milk .\"",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Cans of \"fish assholes\" are another such novelty item, typically just containers of pasta in tomato/cheese sauce akin to Campbell's brand SpaghettiOs . Some versions of this item are specifically identified as being such, while consumers can also purchase just the labels and slap them on their own cans of SpaghettiOs (or similar product).",
