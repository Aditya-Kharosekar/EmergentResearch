  "Origins": "Every year since 1980, between 7 December (the eve of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception) through 10 January, Italy's Mount Ingino (near the town of Gubbio) is home to what is billed as \"the world's largest Christmas tree display.\" As pictured above, several hundred colored lights and 40,000 feet (about 7.5 miles) of cabling are used to create an illuminated outline of an ornamented fir tree along a slope of Mount Ingino, a display that is approximately 1,300 feet tall and 2,600 feet across at its widest point. The tree (whose base is said to be almost as wide as the town itself) stretches from the \"last stone houses of Gubbio\" up to the Basilica of Saint Ubaldo, which houses the 160-by-80-foot star that tops the tree.",
