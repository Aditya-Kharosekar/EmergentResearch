The driver was fortunate to have escaped with only minor injuries.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "(The brown dirt-like material on the Durango's roof is probably fecal matter expelled by the deer. The unfortunate animal likely hit the vehicle on its back, then was thrown forward when the driver stepped on the brakes.)",
