  "Origins": "In August 2014, Facebook users begin seeing posts that featured what looked to be an image from a video of pro wrestler Hulk Hogan bloody and prone, with text indicating that \"Hulk Hogan died after having a deadly head shot today as revenge.\"",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "However, Hulk Hogan is alive and well, and there is no such video to be seen. (The bloodied photo of Hulk Hogan actually comes from a 2009 promotional ' incident ' in Australia when Hogan was 'attacked' by fellow wrestler Ric Flair.) Users who did click through on such links were taken to a faux Facebook page which eventually led them down the trail of the usual survey scam , directing them to \"like\" or \"share\" links with their Facebook friends and complete online surveys, all with the goal of getting them to enrich scammers by disclosing sensitive personal information, spreading malware, buying products, and signing up for costly, difficult-to-cancel services.",
