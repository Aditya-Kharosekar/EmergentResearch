  "Origins": "The popular In-N-Out Burger chain of restaurants, which operate primarily in the American Southwest, is known (among other reasons) for printing references to Bible verses (such as Proverbs 3:5 and Revelation 3:20) on their cups, wrappers, and other packaging material. An image spoofing In-N-Out's religious reputation by purportedly showing the phrase \"Hail Satan\" printed on the bottom of a cup from the restaurant chain has been circulating online since at least 2010, when it was posted to the web site Joy Reactor. However, the \"Hail Satan\" phrase shown obviously just a digitally manipulated version of a photograph of an In-N-Out cup bearing the standard \"John 3:16\" imprint:",
