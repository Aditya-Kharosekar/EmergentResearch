  "Origins": "The Gateway Arch (commonly known as the \"St. Louis Arch\") is one of the United States' most distinctive landmarks, a 630-foot-high, stainless steel-clad monument to the westward expansion of the U.S. which has graced the western bank of the Mississippi River since its completion in 1965.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "In June 2014 an online rumor began circulating to the effect that the venerable arch was slated to be demolished in early 2015. There was no truth to the rumor: although redevelopment plans for the arch and its surrounding grounds are in the works (primarily a renovation and expansion of the museum at the monument's base), the demolition of the arch itself is not an option being considered by anyone. The rumor was just a prank started on one of the plethora of web sites that allow users to create fake news stories and propagate them via social media.",
