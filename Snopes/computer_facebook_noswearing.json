  "Origins": "This message purportedly issued by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims that beginning on 20 March 2014 Facebook will be implementing a 'no swearing' campaign in order to create a \"cleaner family friendly network\" at the request of advertisers, and that users caught swearing on that social network will have their accounts locked pending further investigation, with repeat offenders having their accounts permanently and immediately shut down.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The message is just a hoax: Facebook has made no announcement nor sent any messages about launching an anti-profanity campaign like the one described here. Facebook users have access to profanity filters that will block posts containing certain offensive words, and Facebook's Community Standards and Statement of Rights and Responsibilities sets down some guidelines about posts that might be considered hate speech, bullying, or harassment, but Facebook has no (and is not implementing any) general overall ban on swearing.",
