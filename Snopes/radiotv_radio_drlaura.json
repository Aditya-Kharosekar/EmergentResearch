  "Origins": "On 15 December 2014, SiriusXM radio host Dr. Laura Schlessinger visited an animal shelter as part of a larger segment about ways to combat loneliness in a healthy fashion.

  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "During the segment, Dr. Laura expressed surprise at the number of pit bulls living in the animal shelter she visited. (She maintained that \"about 95%\" of the dogs there were pit bulls or pit bull mixes.) After observing the pit bull situation, Schlessinger remarked that \"I think they should all be put down\" because \"they were taking up space, and nobody was going to adopt them. That's why they were all there people were getting rid of them\": On 19 December 2014, Schlessinger broke from her standard Facebook style of commentary to post an apology to those who were offended by the comments and stated: After reading the emails from pit bull lovers, I realize that my comments were hurtful. I apologize for causing any pit bull owner/fancier any distress.",
