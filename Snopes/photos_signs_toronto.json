  "Origins": "At first blush, the putative study described in the document shown above sounded just technical for some viewers to think it might be plausible:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "In fact, the aspect of this message that readers found most questionable was the word \"otolaryngology,\" which was about the only part of the prank that was genuine: the University of Toronto does have a Department of Otolaryngology (a medical specialty dealing with the ear, nose, and throat). However, they aren't (and weren't) conducting a study to establish whether \"acts of 'rigorous' fellatio may contribute to pathology of the larynx.\" An obvious giveaway here was that in the faux flyer pictured above, the little slips interested parties were supposed to tear off and take with them contained no contact information other than an e-mail address which was not from the University of Toronto, but from a non-existent 'Otolaryngology.MD' domain.",
