  "Origins": "The 81-year-old legendary country singer Willie Nelson is a frequent target of celebrity death hoaxes, the most recent iteration occurring in August 2015. One of the more prominent purveyors of this particular celebrity death hoax has been the fake news web site MSMBC.co (deliberately titled so as to cause confusion with the genuine news site MSNBC.com), which on 21 February 2015 published a false report claiming the famous musician had passed away, then updated their hoax article again on 11 April 2015 and started a new round of the fake Willie Nelson death rumor:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The fake MSMBC.co article unfortunately fooled many readers as it made the rounds of social media again, even though it was completely false and was just a recycled version of the very same prank the site released months earlier. The latter part of the article's statement that the \"story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified,\" is technically correct, as nothing about the story has been \"officially verified\" because none of it is even remotely true. No legitimate news outlet has reported on Nelson's death, which is not surprising since Nelson himself is actually alive and well and just played a show at the Blue Hills Bank Pavilion in Boston.",
