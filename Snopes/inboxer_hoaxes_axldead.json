  "Origins": "On 2 December 2014, MSNBC.website (not MSNBC.com) posted an article titled \"Guns N' Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.\" The site claimed Rose had been found dead in his home, but that the singer's demise had not yet been confirmed:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "However, no reports subsequently emerged to validate the claims made in the article. More tellingly, MSNBC.website has propagated similar hoaxes in the past. Previously, the site (which relies in part on the mistaken assumption by visitors that it is a legitimate part of the MSNBC brand) claimed Macaulay Culkin had died (he hadn't) and the Curiosity Rover found a fish fossil on the Martian surface (it didn't).",
