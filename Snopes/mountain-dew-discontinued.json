  "Origins": "In August 2015, a news-like link reporting that the popular soft drink Mountain Dew (owned by Pepsico) was going to be \"cancelled\" started circulating around social media. Although the link appeared to point to a real news story, it was generated by the trolling web site FeedNewz:",
  "Fact Check": "Is the soft drink Mountain Dew being discontinued?",
  "Description": "The content on FeedNews.com is user created. Anyone with an Internet connection can use the web site, as well as prank.link and fakeshare.com, to create fake news headlines: When social media users click on links created by one of the above-mentioned web sites, they get redirected to a \"You Got Owned\" page. FeedNews.com then encourages anyone who was fooled by the prank to share it again with their own social media circles, ensuring that the pranks go viral: Recently, FeedNewz.com has helped spread fake stories about MMA champion Ronda Rousey failing a drug test, the Taco Bell fast food chain closing all their outlets, and Channing Tatum coming out as gay.
