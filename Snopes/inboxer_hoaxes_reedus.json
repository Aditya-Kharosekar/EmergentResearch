  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "There was no truth to the rumor, however. The claim appears to have originated with an April Fool's Facebook post featuring a payoff that lured victims into a variant of rickrolling . A similar hoax spread in June 2014 held that the actor had been killed in a motorcycle accident.",
