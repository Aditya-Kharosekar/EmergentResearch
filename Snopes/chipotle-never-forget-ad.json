  "Fact Check": "Did Chipotle create a \"never forget\" ad reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks featuring burritos in the place of the Twin Towers?",
  "Description": "The \"never forget\" Chipotle ad was not created by the restaurant chain. While the image's exact origins are not clear (there are no results for this specific image prior to September 2015), a similar image has been circulating around the internet since at least 2013 when it was posted the web site Imgur: While we can't say for certain how the \"never forget\" Chipotle ad made its way into the magazine, it is likely that someone printed a physical copy of the ad posted to Imgur in 2013 and then placed it into a magazine. Regardless, Chipotle has already disclaimed ownership of the ad: Last updated: 21 September 2015",
