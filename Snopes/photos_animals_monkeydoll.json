  "Description": "Madagascar, Southeast Africa Monkey pic.twitter.com/zIp9mOh7LT Nancy (@ballandchain48) March 4, 2015 This photograph, however, does not show an unusual primate from Madagascar. Instead, it shows a doll from the \"Inari Foxes\" collection produced by the Santani Workshop in Russia. The group's Deviant Art page features several related images, including the one displayed above, of mythical creatures made of \"different types of doll plastic like fimo, cernit, sculpey, sonet:\" This isn't the first time that a doll has fooled the internet. In December 2014, a pair of cute (but fake) owlets also went viral on social media.",
