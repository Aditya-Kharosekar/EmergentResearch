  "Origins": "When wishful thinking and a dollop of truth collide, great rumors are created. A September 11 limited giveaway by one airline has sparked a false whisper that all airlines are offering free air travel on the one-year anniversary of America's greatest air disaster.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "On 7 August 2002, Spirit Air offered 13,400 free seats on 90 flights to all of its 14 destinations on September 11. The \"Freedom to Fly\" flights sold out in eight hours. The airline received about 340,000 phone calls and more than one million Internet requests for the free tickets, which were snapped up almost as soon as the offer appeared. Customers who already paid for tickets were issued credit for future flights. Spirit's act is not industry-wide, however; no other airlines are offering free travel on that day. (National Airlines came closest with its \" Salute to Heroes \" promotion, which offered $1 one-way fares on all National flights departing on 11 September 2002.) Because bookings have been soft for the 11th, American and United, the nation's two biggest carriers, have said they are cutting back their September 11 flight schedules. No. 3 Delta is trimming flights for the entire work week of September 9-13. Several European airlines also have canceled flights to the United States on September 11.
