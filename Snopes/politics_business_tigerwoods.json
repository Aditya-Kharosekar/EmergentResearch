  "Origins": "In March 2015, a rumor started circulating online that golfer Tiger Woods chose to name his new restaurant \"The Woods Jupiter\" (rather than \"Tiger Woods Jupiter\" or some variant thereof) because the Nike shoe company owns the rights to his name. The rumor got started when developer Nicholas Mastroianni II spoke to Golf.com about the professional golfer's new business ventures:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "While Mastrioianni undoubtedly has to jump through a few hoops to appease Tiger Woods and the golfer's business people, it appears that the developer has been misinformed about the naming rights. Both Mark Steinberg, Tiger's manager, and a spokesman for Nike have confirmed that Woods is free to use his name on the restaurant: \"I can't imagine how this could have been communicated this way. It is wholly inaccurate and categorically false,\" Steinberg said. \"Tiger owns his own name and always had. He can use his name in any form he chooses. Nike would confirm that if asked.\" Later Wednesday, a Nike spokeswoman did just that, saying, \"Nike does not own the name 'Tiger Woods.' We can confirm that Mark Steinberg's comments are accurate.\"",
