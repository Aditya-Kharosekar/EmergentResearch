  "Origins": "On 19 September 2014, the iPhone 6 hit Apple Stores the world over, creating the standard techie brouhaha and prompting long storeside campouts. One of the lucky first iPhone 6 owners was Jack Cooksey of Perth, Australia ... but the young man was not lucky for very long.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Having notably snagged the first available iPhone 6 in Australia, Cooksey then was approached by a local news team about his purchase. He seemed both excited and slightly unnerved by appearing on live television to show off his new phone, and struggled to pry the white box apart. After a tense few moments of nearly dead air, Cooksey managed to open his iPhone 6 for the camera crew and it promptly dropped from the box and fell face-down onto the pavement. The moment was captured on the news: Whether or not Cooksey's iPhone 6 survived the pavement crash intact remains to be seen. While the device appeared in the video to be largely unmarred by its journey to the sidewalk, some viewers observed the shopper picking at what may have been a small crack at the device's lower left corner.",
