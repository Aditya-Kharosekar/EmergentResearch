  "Origins": "One joke that never seems to get old or at least never seems to get old enough to die off is the picture of the politician holding a telephone upside down (last seen applied to President Bush in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina).",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Few (if any) prominent political figures are really clueless enough to both unknowingly pose holding a telephone upside down and approve the release of publicity pictures displaying such a faux pas, but for the record we note here that the above-displayed image of Barack Obama in a similar pose (which was posted to the IMAO web site on 3 March 2008) is merely a digitally manipulated version of this photograph: The appearance of a clock (set to 3:00) on the far wall has also been added to the manipulated image, presumably as an allusion to Senator Hillary Clinton's controversial \"3:00 AM phone call\" campaign commercial:",
