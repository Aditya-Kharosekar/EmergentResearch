  "Origins": "On 19 August 2015, the web site The Business Standard News (tagline \"BS News, keeping it real\") published an article titled \"FOX News Hires George Zimmerman As Commentator,\" reporting that: George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watchman who killed black teen Trayvon Martin, has been hired as a commentator by FOX News.",
  "Fact Check": "Has Fox News hired George Zimmerman, the man who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, as a commentator?",
  "Description": "A FOX News spokesman said Zimmerman will comment on second amendment and other crime issues. FOX News host Steve Doocy welcomed the decision. \"George has had such a rough time after the trial, we are glad to give him a stable job,\" Doocy said. However, this article was just a spoof of Zimmerman's controversial post-trial endeavors, which include teaming up with the owner of a Florida \"Muslim-free zone\" gun shop to sell Confederate flag artworks. Content on the Business Standard News web site bears the following disclaimer, indicating that is not intended to be taken seriously: The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to poke fun at the absurdity of the modern-day news cycle. The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true. The site wasn't the first to concoct a tale about Fox News' hiring Zimmerman. A fake news article from 2013 made the same claim: In early August 2015, the Business Standard News published a (similarly false) article claiming Fox News commentator Stacey Dash had been secretly recorded trashing the network.
