  "Origins": "1 April 2014 saw the online publishing of an article about the putative discovery of new species of snake known as the Texas Bonnet Rattlesnake, a serpent that had supposedly evolved to sport a blue coloration which allowed it to blend in unnoticed amidst fields of the ubiquitous Texas state flower, the bluebonnet:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The aftermath of every April 1 sees a few online jokes that linger and continue to fool and confuse readers well after that day has come and passed, and this item is proving to be one of them. As indicated by the 1 April 2014 dating of the original article, the description of the Texas Bonnet Rattlesnake's discovery is an April Fool's Day prank, and the creature itself (along with the \"Texas Identification and Taxonomy Association\" organization and the fabricated local television news screen shots embedded in the article) is nothing more than a fictional creation devised in the perpetration of a joke. One can certainly find plenty of rattlesnakes and bluebonnets in Texas, sometimes in the same place, but for now neither species has started resembling the other.",

  "Example": "[Collected via Facebook, April 2014] Texas Hill Country face book page has posted a photo of a supposedly evolved rattlesnake that appears to have adopted blue markings making it possible to blend in with the beautiful road side blue bonnet fields. Since its very common practice for people to catch photo ops wherever these fields of flowers appear, this is big news if it's true.",
