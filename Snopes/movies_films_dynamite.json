  "Description": "The film was shot in Preston , Idaho, a sleepy little town of with a population of about 5,000. Idaho is understandably proud of Jared and Jerusha Hess for writing the film that brought so much positive attention to the state. As an expression of that, Representative Larry Bradford authored a resolution commending these two Preston natives for their movie and put it before Idaho's House of Representatives on 6 April 2005. It reads, in part, \"We commend Jared and Jerusha Hess and the City of Preston for showcasing the positive aspects of Idaho's youth, rural culture, education system, athletics, economic prosperity and diversity.\" The resolution passed in the House by a vote of 69-0. (One representative was absent.) The resolution next moved to the Idaho Senate, where President Pro Tem Robert Geddes allowed the entire resolution to be read, including the section that states: \"Any members of the House of Representatives or the Senate of the Legislature of the State of Idaho who choose to vote Nay on this concurrent resolution are FREAKIN IDIOTS! and run the risk of having the Worst Day of Their Lives!\" The resolution was passed in the Senate by a voice vote. The full text of House Concurrent Resolution No. 29 can be found on the State of Idaho's web site.",
