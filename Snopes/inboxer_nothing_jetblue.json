  "Origins": "In April 2012, a scam purporting to offer a pair of free air travel tickets on JetBlue to those who followed particular links spread via Facebook. Those who went in search of the promised freebies reached Facebook look-alike pages bearing embedded countdown counters that helpfully showed rapidly reducing numbers of tickets to be had.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "There are no free tickets to be had JetBlue is not giving away pairs of air travel tickets. The scam is similar to the November 2011 con purporting to offer pairs of free Southwest Airlines tickets. The web pages the hopeful are led to (which are not operated or sponsored by JetBlue) ask the unwary to repost the message in their profiles and click \"like\" buttons to claim the promised pair of tickets. From there they are redirected to another page asking for their e-mail addresses, then led through a web of proffered deals (which according to their posted Terms and Conditions require those about to be duped and three friends complete a total of 11 \"reward offers\"). It needs to be kept in mind that personal data (name, date of birth, phone numbers, address) submitted via such forms will be shared with other marketers and/or scammers.",
