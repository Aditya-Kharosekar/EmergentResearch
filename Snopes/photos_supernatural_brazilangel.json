The cameraman thought he was captured birds flying, but when zoomed the clip, he realized they were two strange winged creatures that resemble WHAT we may call angels. please watch and see for yourself. But this is not the case. The original video was uploaded on 15 February 2014 by digital artist Jessen Carlos, and although he did not specifically state when he uploaded his original video that the angels had been digitally added, he did post a follow-up video in December 2014 showing how he had created the previous clip: The YouTube video \"Anjos Filmados No C u\" has fooled many viewers since it was uploaded to the Internet. The video, however, does not prove that angels exist, only that they can be created with CGI.",
