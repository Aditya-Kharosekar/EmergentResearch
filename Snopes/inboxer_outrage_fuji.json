  "Origins": "E-mails proclaiming that a particular company has identified Israel as 'Palestine' on a map or directory listing or has omitted Israel entirely with the purported intent of \"courting Arab business\" are not uncommon, although such claims generally turn out to be either inaccurate or the result of mistakes rather than malice or greed. According to Fujifilm, this was yet another example for the \"Inaccurate\" column:",

  "Description": "(NOTE: Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. is indeed the parent company of Subaru of America, Inc., but despite the similarity in names, it has no affiliation with the Fuji company which manufactures film.) According to JTA , Fujifilm \"says it is very concerned about the issue, and had corporate executives in Japan visit the Israeli consulate there to explain the situation.\" A commercial map which does (as of this writing) omit Israel while including Palestine can be found on the dealer locator map for BMW Middle East .",

  "Example": "[Collected on the Internet, 2002] Fuji Co. removed Israel from its complimentary world map which is distributed to their customers with a purchase. Yes, in Fuji stores abroad you receive the world map without Israel!!! According to Fuji, Israel just doesn't exist. It is most likely done to entice Arab customers. Many Israelis today called for boycott of all Fuji products - film, cameras, batteries etc Luckily - there are alternatives: film - Kodak, Agfa, cameras - Nikon, Olimpus, Samsung, Cannon etc. Do not buy anything made by Fuji and encourage others to do likewise! At least not until they change and apologize. Also important to note - Subaru is Fuji.",
