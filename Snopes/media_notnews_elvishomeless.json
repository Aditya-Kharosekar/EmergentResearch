  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, the report was just a spoof of the ubiquitous \"Elvis is alive\" and \"Elvis faked his death\" rumors that have circulated ever since the singer passed away in August 1977, accompanied by an artificial rendering of what an elderly Elvis might look like. The spoof was published by the Empire News , a fake news web site that issues fictional stories such as \"Cure for Cancer Discovered; 'Amazingly Simple' Says Researcher,\" and \"College Student Excused from Classes After Dog Eats Grandmother,\" and \"Woman Gives Birth, Confuses Doctors by Asking for Maternity Test.\" The site's disclaimer notes that \"Empire News is intended for entertainment purposes only.\"",
