  "Origins": "Tales about the Bermuda Triangle (also known as the Devil's Triangle), a region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean where a number of aircraft and ships are claimed to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances, date to the early 1950s. And rumors of a tantalizing crystal pyramid found on ocean's floor go back at least as far as the 1960s, which is when a Dr. Ray Brown claimed he came upon such a structure while scuba diving in the Bahamas, as detailed in this 1980 clip from an In Search of ... segment on the Bimini Wall (an underwater rock formation near North Bimini island in the Bahamas):",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "As frequently seems to happen with such earth-shaking paranormal discoveries, however, \"Dr. Brown's photographic equipment was destroyed in the storm, thus making it impossible for a detailed record of the find.\" And after his supposed incredible discovery of a crystal Atlantean pyramid, Dr. Brown never saw fit to return to the site with additional cameras to document it, even though this amazing structure was found in an area reachable with ordinary scuba diving gear.",
