  "Origins": "On 4 June 2015, the web site The Stately Harold published an article titled \"Ted Cruz, The Texas Floods Are Caused by Native American Rain Dances.\" The article reported that on 4 June 2015 Cruz, a Republican presidential candidate and U.S. Senator, blamed Native American rain dances for deadly floods that affected areas of Texas in May 2015:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Readers were invited to discuss its claims under the hashtag #CruzRainDance, presumably to object to the offensive and polarizing content presented by the article. But the Stately Harold 's disclaimer clearly explains that the site's content is not factual: The Stately Harold is a satirical website. None of the stories have a grain of truth to them and the opinions do not belong to real people. Days before the \"rain dance\" yarn, the Stately Harold published an article claiming that Sen. Cruz was overheard using a racial slur when describing President Obama. That site (and many others ) like it have made our lists of fake news sites whose articles dupe social media users every now and again.",
