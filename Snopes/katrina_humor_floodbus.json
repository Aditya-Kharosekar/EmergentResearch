  "Description": "The original photograph of floodwaters has no connection to New Orleans or Hurricane Katrina it was taken at a bus garage during an April 2005 flood in Port Jervis, New York: And the other portion came from a photo of a transit bus taken in Calgary, Alberta: In any case, it's kind of refreshing to see a bit of Katrina-related humor that doesn't involve a commentary on politics, race, or class, or depend upon its shock value. Instead, this one expresses a simple sentiment about the New Orleans disaster that most everyone can agree with.",
