  "Origins": "An incident in May 2012 involving a confrontation between two naked men in Miami in which one tried to chew off the face of the other before being shot by police led to myriad comparisons and jokes about the event being an indicator of an impending \"zombie apocalypse.\" One such jape was that the dead face-eating man had not been high on bath salts (a form of drug) as originally reported (further investigation revealed marijuana but no bath salts in his system) but had been infected with LQP-79, a virus that supposedly \"destroys internal organs and affects the brain waves to make you hungry for human flesh,\" as described in the following spoof (created by altering a related Huffington Post article ):",
