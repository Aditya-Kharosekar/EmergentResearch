  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Soon afterwards links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, the article was just a bit of satire from Daily Buzz Live , a web site that publishes fictional stories such as \"Starbucks Apologizes for Serving Satanic Coffee to Catholic Teacher,\" and \"Get Ready: Obama to Implement the New American Currency Called the ' Amero .'\" Daily Buzz Live 's disclaimer notes the site offers items that are not news, but rather fictional reports \"inspired\" by real events. (The only ongoing Twilight movie project announced so far involves short films detailing selected characters' backstories.)",
