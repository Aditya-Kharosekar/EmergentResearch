  "Origins": "The image displayed above (click on the graphic to enlarge it) is purportedly a screen capture of a Fox News report on the March 2012 killings of three French soldiers, three Jewish schoolchildren, and a rabbi at a Jewish school in Toulouse, France. The image includes added text supposedly revealing a plethora of geographic, political, and spelling errors (e.g., incorrectly locating France on a map of Europe, misspelling the city of Toulouse as \"Toolooz,\" misidentifying the French Minister of the Interior as the country's president, referring to Arabs and Jews as the \"Asian community,\" labeling the shooter a Buddhist rather than a Muslim) in this Fox News report:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "In fact, the image is not real; it's an altered version of a screen capture of a Fox News report from June 2011 covering the subject of potential 2012 Republican presidential contenders: The original June 2011 screen capture was preserved by Mediabistro for featuring a small error of its own: It included a picture of comedienne Tina Fey portraying Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live rather than a genuine picture of the 2008 vice-presidential nominee herself.",
