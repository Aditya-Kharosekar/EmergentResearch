  "Description": "By the following day links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, the article was just a spoof from the Spring Hill Courier , a web site that publishes fictional stories set in the Florida town of Spring Hill, such as \"Spring Hill Podiatrist Charged with Performing Abortions for Underage Girls,\" \"Tiger Woods Spotted Shopping for Wedding Ring at Kohl's on Spring Hill Drive,\" and \"Spring Hill Man Claims Security Guard Impersonator Pulled Him Over, Sexually Assaulted Him on Roadside Three Days in a Row.\" The Spring Hill Courier 's \" About Us \" page notes that the site is a satirical publication: The Spring Hill Courier is a satirical publication that uses invented names with the lone exception being the public figures being satirized. Any other use of real names is coincidental.",
