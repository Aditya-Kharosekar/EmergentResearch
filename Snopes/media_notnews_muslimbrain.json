  "Origins": "On 28 September 2015, the National Report web site published an article reporting that Republican presidential candidate (and former neurosurgeon) Dr. Ben Carson had proclaimed that \"a Muslim's brain is different\":",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Although Dr. Carson did generate controversy by stating on Meet the Press that he \"would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation\" because Islam is not \"consistent with the Constitution,\" the rest of the National Report article about his supposedly asserting that \"a Muslim's brain is wired differently than ours\" is a total fabrication. The National Report is a fake news site whose disclaimer page notes that all of the site's articles are fiction: National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.",
