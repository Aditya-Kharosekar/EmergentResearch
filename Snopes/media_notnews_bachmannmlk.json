  "Origins": "On 19 January 2015, an image of Michele Bachmann along with a quote purportedly uttered by her about gun rights and the assassination of Martin Luther King began circulating on the Internet. The image received a viral push when it was posted to Reddit's \"Forwards from Grandma\" subreddit . The text from the image was also posted to the Orange County community politics section on Craigslist :",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Both of these instances claim Bachmann uttered the phrase during the Martin Luther King Jr. Day Festival in St. Paul, Minnesota on 19 January 2015. While it is true several prominent Minnesota politicians, including Gov. Mark Dayton, St. Paul mayor Chris Coleman, and U.S. senators Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken joined citizens in the Twin Cities to honor Martin Luther King, there is no evidence showing Michele Bachmann was present at that event. Furthermore, Bachmann and her dubious diatribe were not mentioned by any local newspapers, and the only place where this questionable quote appeared was on a viral Michele Bachmann meme and a single California Craigslist post about an event that supposedly happened in Minnesota. It should also be noted this Michele Bachmann meme has nothing to do with Fox News. The photo was taken by Reuters photographer Jeff Haynes at a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa, on 9 December 2011. The Fox News logo was later digitally superimposed over the image.",
