  "Origins": "A YouTube video announcement issued on 31 March 2013 proclaimed that \"after eight amazing years,\" the popular video hosting site would be shutting down the following day and no longer accepting submissions. Instead, said the company, \"it's finally time to review everything that has been uploaded to our site and begin the process of selecting a winner\" (a process estimated to take ten years), with the site displaying the winning video as its sole entry upon its reopening in 2023.",
