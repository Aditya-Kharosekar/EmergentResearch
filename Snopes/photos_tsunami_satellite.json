  "Origins": "We don't know how anyone could mistake a photograph of a weather phenomenon (a hurricane) in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida with a seismic/oceanic phenomenon (a tsunami) which occurred in the Indian Ocean and struck the coasts of several Asian countries, but here we have it.",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Even if we knew nothing else about this photograph, we could eliminate it as a picture of the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, because it has already been circulating for months as a satellite photograph of Hurricane Frances, a storm that struck Florida in September 2004. In fact, the picture is even older than that it's a satellite image of Hurricane Floyd from September 1999.",
