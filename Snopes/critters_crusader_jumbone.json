  "Origins": "On 18 December 2014, a Facebook user posted the following vague warning about Pedigree brand Jumbone dog treats to the social network: URGENT. Don't give your dogs these. Pedigree Uk are re-calling them. You need to contact them if your dog has had one/been poorly. Please let all your doggy friends and family know. This warning apparently stemmed from a single, unsubstantiated item posted to Facebook a month earlier by a pet owner who claimed her dog had become seriously ill due to consumption of Jumbones:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "The warning resonated with dog lovers on Facebook, and the message was shared tens of thousands of times in the span of a few days. On 22 December 2014 the official Twitter account for Pedigree UK addressed the Jumbone warning message, stating that the claim about a recall was false: These reports are false. We can confirm that there are no problems with Pedigree Jumbone. It's safe to eat and we pride ourselves on producing nutritious food that meets the highest quality and safety standards.",
