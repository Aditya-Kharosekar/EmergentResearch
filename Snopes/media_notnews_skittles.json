  "Origins": "In May 2015, the fake news web site Huzlers published an article reporting that the FDA caught several Skittles factories lacing their candy products with cocaine:",
  "Fact Check": "",
  "Description": "Today, multiple Skittles Factories were busted after it was discovered that they have been using cocaine to make their Skittles. The factories were busted after FDA Inspectors unexpectedly decided to inspect all Skittles factories nationwide. There is no truth to the above-quoted story. Huzlers is one of many \"satirical\" (i.e., fake news) sites operating on the Internet, and their disclaimer states that Huzlers is the \"most notorious urban satirical website with the most shocking headlines and articles.\" While Huzlers writes about a wide variety of fake topics, the web site is particularly fond of product adulteration rumors. The web site has recently published fake stories claiming that cocaine had been found in cans of Coors Lite, that semen was being used in Starbucks drinks, and urine was a main ingredient in AriZona Iced Tea. Although the premises behind these stories are largely unbelievable, thousands of people have shared these articles as real news on social media. Did you fall for any of the above hoaxes?
