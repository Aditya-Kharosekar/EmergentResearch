  "Description": "No such tragic fate has befallen the popular singer, however. Not only are the accounts of her death a hoax, but those reports are being spread by a malicious Facebook app. When users are tricked into clicking through on these fake \"R.I.P Celine Dion\" posts to see the promised news videos, they end up installing a rogue app that posts the same very thing to other Facebook pages in their name. Facebook's Desktop Help section provides users with instructions they can follow to remove unwanted apps from their accounts.",
